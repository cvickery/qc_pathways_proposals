    <h1 class="document-title">QC Approved Pathways Proposals</h1>
    <h2 class="document-title">November, 2012 through October, 2017</h2>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>
      This is an archive of proposals for Pathways Common Core (Required Core and Flexible Core)
      courses that were approved by the Queens College Academic Senate and the CUNY Common Core
      Review Committee (CCRC). The Senate’s Undergraduate Curriculum Committee assigned the task of
      collecting and reviewing these proposals to the <em>ad hoc</em> General Education Advisory
      Committee (GEAC). The chair of GEAC, Christopher Vickery, developed a database and website
      for managing proposal submissions, peer review, and subsequent public record. The College has
      stopped hosting the website, but a copy of the underlying database has been preserved, and
      was used to generate this archive of the successful propoposals.
    </p>

    <p>
      CCRC proposals must be accompanied by a highly-structured sample syllabus for the course.
      Those syllabi are not included in this archive.
    </p>

    <p>
      College Option requirements are not subject to CCRC review, and need only be approved by the
      Academic Senate. Those proposals are included in this archive as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this archive, each course was examined in the <em>current</em> CUNYfirst course catalog.
      Courses that are currently missing or inactive are noted. Otherwise, each course’s current
      title is given, followed by a series of course properties in square brackets. Within the
      square brackets, the first property is the <em>designation</em>, which will normally match the
      proposal type. Following the designation, WI means the course is writing intensive, while LIT,
      LANG, SCI, and SYN indicate the four college option categories.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Implementation Note:</strong> The archive used a preserved copy of the database to
      build a static web page using Python code. That code is
      <a href="https://github.com/cvickery/qc_pathways_proposals">publicly available on GitHub</a>.
      That web page was then converted to PDF using the <a href="https://princexml.com">Prince</a>
      conversion tool. (That’s the Prince logo in the upper right corner of this page). A dump of
      the Postgres database is available from the author.

<p><a href="#criteria-EC-1">EC-1 Criteria Definitions</a></p>
<div><a href="#EC-1ENGL110">ENGL 110</a></div>
<h3 id="EC-1ENGL110">ENGL 110 College Writing I [EC]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-01-25</h4>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> Note: English 110 courses are topics-based and are supervised by the English department. We are submitting a syllabus document that contains two separate syllabi that illustrate how two representative topics meet Pathways learning outcomes for English Composition I. In our justifications we refer to one representative syllabus as the “Small Worlds” syllabus and to the other as the “Reading Film” syllabus. Most class sessions, students prepare a reading assignment by analyzing it as a rhetorical model as well as a source of evidence.  Class discussions focus closely on this analysis of written texts.

This course further requires students to consider the style and content of arguments meta-analytically, considering how a theme is developed and supported. The Ferguson syllabus mentions identification and practice of rhetorical strategies of persuasion, for example, as well as the evaluation of “appropriate secondary sources for an academic essay.” Assignments listed on page 2 of this syllabus further show how students must critically reflect upon received arguments, questioning their effectiveness through written responses that use supporting evidence.</p>
<p><strong>EC-2:</strong> Students write four essays with drafts over the course of the semester.   The feedback that they receive from their instructors provides a model for the feedback that they give to their peers in writing groups.   Citation is taught at the beginning of the semester and practiced throughout. 

Formal assignments, some of which must include elements of research, are required of all English 110 courses. Students use MLA research and citation to practice representative academic conventions in the humanities. All EC 110 courses at Queens College provide attention to grammar and mechanics of English. Students further learn to identify personal strengths and weaknesses in the process of composition and to describe methods to achieve further success.</p>
<p><strong>EC-3:</strong> In the required research unit, required in all iterations of this course, students learn how to locate and evaluate sources using relevant database, and they practice the rhetorical devices that enable scholars to integrate sources in the service of analytical arguments.

As seen in the Ferguson syllabus, students generate an annotated bibliography, discriminating through the research process how to best find and synthesize research that further supports their own critical argument. The practice of research skills is introduced as a “scaffold” (to use a comp. rhetoric term), presented in stages, wherein students identify supporting arguments in rhetorical models, learn to acquire research through visits to the library, evaluate their findings in the context of the discipline, then work and rework such research into their own final paper.</p>
<p><strong>EC-4:</strong> The assignment sequences for ENG 110 introduce students to the range of writing assignments that they will encounter in General Education courses.  In class discussions, students contrast the essays that they read and write, noting the disciplinary differences that structure the scholarly community.

Great emphasis is put upon “identifying a thesis, offering analysis, using evidence” in this course. All of the lengthy written assignments ask for an effectively stated position of an argument in response to relevant questions found among a variety of disciplines and audiences. Students develop their argument with research as well as their own critical reasoning for different audiences: for the professor, their peers, as well as the presumed larger academic audiences interested in rhetoric as well as specific thematic designations of this course.</p>
<p><strong>EC-5:</strong> A central goal of ENG 110 is to provide an introduction to the proper use of scholarly sources for argumentation across the disciplines.  At least one library session is required, and the standards of academic integrity are taught explicitly.

Assignments for different iterations of this course ask for the formulation of original ideas, relating to arguments of others (both presumed as well as established publications). MLA research and citation is required. All such department courses require a statement about plagiarism. Syllabi offer a link to the CUNY policy on Academic Integrity.</p>

<h3 id="EC-2BIOL13">BIOL 13 Writing in the Sciences- Life Science Themes [EC]</h3><h4>Approved 2014-01-27</h4>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> Bio 013, “Writing in the Sciences”, is an English Composition 2/College Writing 2 Course, offered by the Biology Department, that requires students to read and critically evaluate scientific literature, and ultimately model their own writing based on various formats of science literature.  Since the course is structured around writing for different audiences (1)Scientists writing for themselves; 2)Scientists writing for scientists; 3)Scientists writing for students; and 4)Scientists writing for society), students will be reading and analyzing the stylistic components of primary and secondary texts  - field logs (e.g. Darwin’s original “Journal of Researches”); journal articles and abstracts; textbook passages; essays, articles and books for general audiences. 
In-class discussions evaluating texts, and pre-draft writing exercises will help students learn to identify and support an argument.</p>
<p><strong>EC-2:</strong> This course is centered around “writing science” in varying formats for different  audiences. Four formal writing assignments are given, one for each of the defined audiences - A Field Journal log (Scientists writing for themselves), a “Perspectives” article for the journal “Science” (Scientists writing for scientists), a passage for an Evolution textbook (Scientists writing for students), and an essay for “Natural History” Magazine (Scientists writing for society).  Each assignment will be written in standard English, and formatted appropriately for a specific audience. Students will critique each other’s work and revise writing for a final draft based on feedback.</p>
<p><strong>EC-3:</strong> All formal writing assignments will require students to research topics using appropriate primary and secondary sources. In particular, the “Perspectives” article for a scientific journal will necessitate that students gather information from multiple sources and evaluate the “perspectives” presented. A class library visit will aid students in navigating research tools and technology.</p>
<p><strong>EC-4:</strong> In-class discussions and pre-draft writing assignments will address the development of a thesis and the structuring of a written work to effectively communicate a particular perspective. Evaluating texts and other sources (e.g. video, film) designed for specific audiences, and then formatting original writing for specific audiences, will enable students to gain experience in effective communication across a variety of media, and for diverse purposes.</p>
<p><strong>EC-5:</strong> All formal writing assignments for this course require that students develop original ideas, grounded in course readings, additional texts and media. The conventions of citation and bibliography will be discussed in relation to each formal writing assignment.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-3:</strong> There will be informal or pre-draft writing incorporated into most classes. A sequence of lesson plans with informal writing assignments has been developed for this course and may be found on the EC2/CW2 website, linked to “Writing in the Sciences - Evolutionary Themes”.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-2:</strong> There are four formal, graded writing assignments for the course, each requiring an original draft and a final draft, constituting a minimum of 21 pages of revised writing. In-class critiques and workshops on student writing will be a regular component of the course.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-1:</strong> Formal writing instruction will be incorporated into each class, in addition to critiques and discussion of student work. This course has been developed in conjunction with the Writing at Queens program. Lesson plans for this course, Writing in the Sciences - Evolutionary Themes, may be viewed on the EC2/CW2 Website.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-1:</strong> Students in all majors will be required to take an EC2/CW2 course.  This course topic may be particularly relevant for students who plan a major within the Division of Math and Natural Sciences, particularly Biology.</p>

<h3 id="EC-2CMLIT100">CMLIT 100 Writing about World Literature [EC]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-06-03</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Students are asked to read three primary texts from literatures around the globe; and one secondary theoretical essay. All of these are discussed in class; and written about by the students. The emphasis is on writing. There are shorter assignments such as response papers, creative writing, research and bibliography, in-class essays, and oral presentations; and one longer research paper, to be produced in stages. Students are asked to perform close readings of primary texts, which can be novels, short stories, plays, or poems; and to research their historical backgrounds, as well as engage with secondary, theoretical and critical essays. They produce their own critical writings based on individual interpretation and a working thesis arrived at through a process of intellectual inquiry that focuses on the comparative method of analysis and differentiation. Questions are asked in dialogue with the instructor and/or small groups of students, based on previously assigned specific topics. In addition, there are informal  assignments in the “writer’s notebook,” where students record their progress and document their research. The class is taught as both a seminar and a writing workshop, including assignments such as responding to other students’ writing; and practicing a variety of rhetorical strategies that are applicable to the discipline of Comparative Literature and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Comparative Literature provides a unique forum for cross-cultural awareness, because it examines the contributions of all peoples to the human adventure. As part of this adventure, we believe that interpretation and translation – the arts of understanding one another by thinking across cultural and linguistic boundaries – are crucial to navigating the challenges of living in this now globalized world. By comparing and contrasting different languages and cultures, Comparative Literature invites students to expand their horizons and consider the perspectives of others; and to recognize, without glossing over tangible differences, the similarities between all members of the human race. Comparative Literature courses encourage students to question their previous modes of thinking and to welcome complexity and multiplicity into their worldviews. By the very methods of our discipline – comparison and contrast – we demonstrate that any balanced understanding of the world must encompass more than one point of view. This approach fosters critical thinking and analysis; and invites an appreciation for literature and the arts in their social, historical and cultural contexts across the globe.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> The selection of three primary texts from different languages, countries and historical time periods, along with one theoretical essay, helps students hone their skills at differentiation through reading, discussion, and writing. They are asked to provide evidence for assumptions by supporting their point of view with quotations from the primary texts; and they are asked to summarize and paraphrase the theoretical essay, so as to refer to it as a point of departure for their own argument. Students are taught close reading and analysis, with the goal not to read subjective opinions into the text, but to listen carefully to what the text has to say before drawing any conclusion. To this end, rhetorical strategies and figurative language in the texts are discussed. And students are introduced to terminology (e.g. narrative point of view, rhyme schemes, dramatic structure) that helps them conceptualize and write about those texts. Rather than simply identifying with characters in a story, students learn to approach literary and theoretical texts as products of specific cultures and time periods; and to think of them critically and analytically. 
One way in which the discipline of Comparative Literature is specifically suited to read critically is by drawing attention to translation as a way of rendering students aware of the benefits and vicissitudes of cross-cultural communication. When teaching Kafka in this course, for example, the instructor draws attention to the differences between an older translation (the Muirs) and one that is more recent (Breon Mitchell) to demonstrate what is lost and found in translation. All Comparative Literature courses, by definition, emphasize translation as a form of linguistic, literary, and cultural criticism.</p>
<p><strong>EC-2:</strong> Students learn how to edit their work to take charge of their own unique voices as authors. The aim is to render students aware that they have control over their voices - including the possibility to choose rhetorical strategies - to become comfortable with the notion of editing themselves, based on their own internal critical faculties. Students are asked to write in different registers and genres, i.e., personal, academic, essayistic, creative, to become aware that one can choose one’s way of writing depending on the impression one wants to create. An initial writing sample and response paper encourages students to respond to what they have read in familiar terms. The subsequent midterm paper then asks them to respond in more scholarly terms, including direct quotation and an engagement with a theoretical essay. The creative writing exercise, in turn (for this particular course to write down a dream in Kafkaesque language) is designed to illustrate a writerly technique (e.g. unreliable narration) that can be practiced and, therefore, analyzed. and to show that all forms of writing are also creative. The course then turns to the longer task of creating a formal research paper, which requires elaborate engagement with secondary criticism and other relevant sources. Here, the aim is to develop one’s authoritative voice as a scholar, which includes the mastery of college-level standard English and use of appropriate technology (electronic sources, word processing, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>EC-3:</strong> Students learn how to locate and evaluate sources, generate working and selected bibliographies, and properly cite relevant quotations for their arguments. Research topics are narrowed down and developed independently in consultation with the instructor and through peer review. Students are introduced to historical backgrounds (e.g. France in the 19th century); cultural contexts (e.g. pop culture in Japan); and literary critical concepts (e.g. autobiography). Students locate sources from databases, such as the MLA, and learn to locate and download articles from e-journals, JStore etc. They are asked to use the Queens College Library catalogue (CUNY+), for books in the stacks or on closed reserve; and for e-reserve items. They learn to differentiate between the kind of sources easily available on the internet and those constituting more serious scholarship (i.e., peer-reviewed articles). They are guided through the process of gradual elimination that results in a selected bibliography tailored to their specific project, after having generated a longer, more broadly oriented working bibliography (as in editing one’s writing, one has to say “good-bye” to a lot of material that may have seemed useful at first). Through this process, students master the ability to identify and abstract from the massive amounts of information that exist in today’s world. And, they learn to distinguish between their objects of study, the literary works themselves, and the numerous theoretical works that constitute the body of secondary criticism precipitated by these works.</p>
<p><strong>EC-4:</strong> For their research paper, students present their preliminary topic to the class and the instructor. Then they produce an outline with a working thesis, based on a question they might have about their chosen topic. The answer to this question is their working thesis (or: “hypothesis”), which they must then set out to defend, i.e., prove its validity with supporting evidence. The paper they produce should begin with an opening paragraph containing a thesis statement that functions like a road map; and is reiterated throughout the paper to guide the reader along the path of their argument.
The method of Comparative Literature is particularly well suited to communicate across a variety of contexts, purposes and media, insofar as it always prompts students to compare and contrast. We focus on one topic but the understanding of this topic is generated via analysis of two or more stories, poems, films, or other primary texts, so that each is appreciated as unique because it appears in contrast to another. The goal is to create perspective rather than centering on only one object of study (which might lead to a subjective bias because one excludes other points of view). Writing comparative papers asks students to be more analytical by juxtaposing one literary text against another. They learn to use terms of differentiation, contradiction, and paradox, such as:  “However,” “Unlike in the previously discussed work”, “In contrast to” etc. to avoid mere descriptions or appraisal.  They are encouraged to present a debatable thesis (not just a statement of fact) that illuminates an aspect of their chosen topic, seen through the light of the specific works they analyze. The comparative method rests on the ability to carefully analyze a selected passage, line, or scene in which one discovers, not superimposes, meaning. The aim is to encourage perceptive and creative readings (rather than those based on preconceived notions or other people’s opinions).</p>
<p><strong>EC-5:</strong> The formulation of original ideas takes place through the Q/A process that is part of developing a working thesis. The course begins with writing only about a primary text in a response paper, but then quickly proceeds to a theoretical essay (here Erich Auerbach on Realism in Flaubert) which must be responded to in kind. Students are encouraged to agree/disagree with the critic’s particular take on the author they have read (Flaubert), and to use the theoretical essay as a point of departure to critically pursue what is to become their own specific interpretation. This hones their skills of comprehending literary criticism; and of incorporating it into their writing. As they proceed to conduct their own, independent research, they are rendered aware of the similarities and differences between what they themselves think in relation to what others have already published; and they come to see themselves as part of a community of scholars (as those who are “in the know” on an equal level and have the authority to voice their own opinions vis-a-vis those of others). Students in this class are taught to practice the conventions of literary citation according to MLA guidelines; along with rhetorical strategies that allow them to refute or elaborate another critic’s statements: phrases such as “I will use x’s reflections on y’s poem as a point of departure for my own proposition that the poem should be read as [fill in thesis statement]” or “While I disagree with z’s assertion that this metaphor suggests xyz, it is important to note [fill in your own observation] or “abc’s insight with respect to xyz is crucial because it shows [fill in the information] and this enables me to argue [fill in your own line of thinking]”. Students learn that they have the authority, as writers, to question experts rather than just seeing themselves as passive consumers of a knowledge that seems to be untouchable because it is always already “out there.” This understanding encourages them to actively develop their own authorial position and hence avoid plagiarism (which is often based on a student feeling “intimidated” by knowledge perceived as sacrosanct). It provides a democratic forum for intellectual exchange, as students become empowered to speak for themselves. And, of course, they are introduced to the conventions of ethical attribution this approach necessitates.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-1:</strong> Instruction on writing is initially provided in writing, via handout (here: ”Guidelines for Writing a Comparative Literature Paper,” available upon request) that details the process of developing a thesis, conducting research, and comparing and contrasting as a method. This information functions as a basic outline for the writing process, as taught in this particular class (each instructor devises his/her own handout). The effort in class discussions (taught seminar-style) is to render students aware of their ability to “translate” spoken into written language: they are, usually, willing to defend their point of view orally (i.e., when it is not “on record”), yet hesitant to express that same point in writing. This ability to speak and write freely, yet sound scholarly (writing is less casual, more formal) is the central learning experience promoted by this particular class. Instruction on writing provides students with tools to argue on paper, without sounding as if they were speaking. These include revision, i.e., the necessity to look at one’s writing after one has, supposedly, “finished” it; the consideration of grammatical modes (when to use “I”); of essay structure (introduction, body of text, conclusion); and syntax (using paradox instead of declarative statements). In fact, rhetorical modes that permit doubt and, therefore, debate, are shown to alter the quality of an argument (e.g. ”arguably” or “while it may appear as if...it is is not...”); so that the course draws on English 110 but on a more advanced level. Students are asked to share difficulties they experience in their writing, as well as constructively critique each other’s work in a workshop format (small groups). Whereas more advanced courses will expect students to write more on their own, this course devotes much of its time to writing as a way of approaching the literary and theoretical texts that constitute its object of study. It is, in that sense, part of a continuum of writing instruction at Queens College.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-2:</strong> The assignment that requires multiple revisions is the research paper, whose development rests on consulting sources and revising one’s working thesis in the process. It is suggested that the student create two initial files: one with quotations from the primary texts to be analyzed (e.g. Murakami, Kafka) and another with quotations from secondary sources. This isolates what will constitute the most important elements of a research paper in Comparative Literature: close analysis of a literary work; along with engagement with scholars who have analyzed that same work (and/or written about topics directly relevant to that work). However, while the research paper is most labor-intensive, there are several other formal, graded writing assignments in this course. These address the initial ability to read closely without conducting research (response paper); the ability to compare and contrast in light of a theoretical vantage point already provided (midterm paper); and the ability to write creatively, in an altogether different mode (the purpose of this assignment is for students to recognize a given writer’s technique, to learn that it is possible to not only comment upon, but also practice that technique, which brings them closer to it). The course asks students to write in different genres and registers, and to differentiate between different writing techniques at their disposal.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-3:</strong> This course includes keeping a writer’s notebook in which to take notes during class, record research, and respond to questions posted in advance (on Blackboard, to facilitate in-class discussion). The writer’s notebook is checked in the middle of the semester and collected at the end, to be graded on a Pass/Fail basis. Periodically, students are encouraged to share their notes orally with the class, so that they can compare their ideas with those of others; and to develop the habit of note-taking, which they must also use in preparation for oral presentations. Some instructors who teach this course may choose to use blogs or other means of informal communication, but what seems useful about a writer’s notebook is that one may not choose to share all of its contents (though it will be looked at by the professor), ensuring a degree of privacy that differs from that of blogs (where one may regret having posted something one may later reconsider). In this context, the question of authorship is emphasized in practice: which writing is private/public and who gets to decide? Apart from the writer’s notebook, there are
informal assignments such as the brief analysis of a given passage from a literary text to initiate discussion; or brief responses to foster an initial engagement with the text (e.g.  “Is it funny that Flaubert ends the story about a woman by referring to her parrot?”); or the structural analysis of the text by making a list of negative/positive elements; or narrative analysis of what happens at what point in the story (drawing boxes on the whiteboard to summarize each segment of the text), thereby identifying recurring themes, shifts in perspective, etc. The aim of these informal assignments is always to arrive at a better understanding of the primary texts as the objects of study in the discipline of Comparative Literature.</p>

<h3 id="EC-2DRAM130">DRAM 130 Writing About Performance [EC]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-06-13</h4>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> Students perform close readings of performance-related writing (for instance:  performance review essays, grant proposals, artists’ statements, and research papers on performance subjects) and are asked during class time to break them down in terms of rhetorical strategies and evidence, noticing in particular the skill of using “description as evidence.”  The emphasis is on close reading for craft — in other words, students are asked to observe how professional writers are shaping their arguments and deploying their evidence in order that they may model these techniques in their own writing.</p>
<p><strong>EC-2:</strong> Students will create multiple drafts of performance-related writing, often in reaction to performances they have viewed live or on video.  Each iteration of this course, of which more than one is in preparation, will include at least three of the following formats:  the performance review essay, the grant proposal, the artist’s statement, the research paper on a performance subject (always included), and the cover letter (always included).  First drafts of all assignments will undergo peer review during class time (sometimes in pairs, sometimes in a full class workshop) before a final draft is due.  Both peer reviews and the in-class exercises in writing mechanics will emphasize clarity of expression.</p>
<p><strong>EC-3:</strong> Students will be taught research skills both generalizable to all disciplines and specific to the performing arts, culminating in a field trip to the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.    They will be given hands-on instruction in the use of performing arts databases and the considerable archive of video materials at the NYPL.  Class time is set aside to instruct on proper selection, incorporation and citation of sources.</p>
<p><strong>EC-4:</strong> Persuasive communication, with supported theses and well-reasoned arguments, is a key feature of many of the genres of writing that will be studied and modeled in this course.  The performance review convinces a potential audience to see a work of art through the writer’s eyes (and potentially to purchase or not purchase a ticket); the artist statement leads an audience into a receptive state of mind and convinces them of the complexity and worth of what they are about to view; the grant proposal convinces an institution to invest its money in an artists’ vision. Students may not understand at first how a research paper is persuasive writing, but they will be led to understand how effective argument is essential for that genre as well.  Central to the investigation of writing about performance will also be the question of audience – what does the audience already know?  What do they need explained to them? – and the skill of writing to a wide variety of audiences.  One unit of the course explicitly asks the students to compare and contrast performance writing across different contexts, purposes and audiences.</p>
<p><strong>EC-5:</strong> Students will be taught to recognize all the situations where attribution is required, and how to cite properly in a variety of contexts (from a less formal in-line citation in a review essay, to a formal research citation for the research paper)</p>
<p><strong>CW2-3:</strong> There are seven informal writing assignments on the class blog over the course of the semester, some of which feed into the more formal writing, and some of which are independent.  There are also frequent in-class writing exercises — both free-writing to generate inspiration and more structured exercises in writing mechanics.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-2:</strong> The total amount of formal graded writing due over the semester falls between 22-28 pages.  Of those pages, 16-22 of them must undergo revision.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-1:</strong> The entire course is structured around instruction on writing – from short exercises in writing mechanics, to reading and discussing professional writer’s reflections on their craft, to building up final drafts of formal writing from informal blog posts, to going through the revision process aided by professor comments and in-class peer review.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE-3:</strong> Ideally, as this course is labor-intensive for the instructor and benefits from lots of student-instructor interaction, it would be capped at 20 instead of 25.</p>
<h3 id="EC-2ENGL130">ENGL 130 Writing about Literature In English [EC]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-04-16</h4>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> For most class sessions, students prepare a reading assignment by analyzing it as a rhetorical model as well as a source of evidence. Class discussions focus closely on this analysis of written texts.</p>
<p><strong>EC-2:</strong> Students write four essays with drafts over the course of the semester. The feedback that they receive from their instructors provides a model for the feedback that they give to their peers in writing groups. Citation is taught at the beginning of the semester and practiced throughout.</p>
<p><strong>EC-3:</strong> In the required research unit, students learn how to locate and evaluate sources using relevant database, and they practice the rhetorical devices that enable scholars to integrate sources in the service of analytical arguments.</p>
<p><strong>EC-4:</strong> The assignment sequences for EC2 introduce students to the range of writing assignments that they will encounter in upper-division courses. In class discussions, students contrast the essays that they read and write, noting the disciplinary differences that structure the scholarly community.</p>
<p><strong>EC-5:</strong> A central goal of EC2 is to deepen students’ expertise in the proper and effective use of scholarly sources. At least one library session is required, and the standards of academic integrity are taught explicitly.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-1:</strong> Syllabus includes specific instructions on writing.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-2:</strong> Page requirements on proposed syllabus add up  to required pages of formal writing. Revision is required on at least one assignment (several more on this syllabus).</p>

<h3 id="EC-2EURO120">EURO 120 Writing about European Literature and Culture [EC]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-06-13</h4>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> Throughout the course, students are expected to (1) read primary sources and take notes on them in specific interpretive categories; (2) discuss these readings in class, with particular attention to how arguments, plot, character, voice, setting, style, genre, and/or context are constructed and developed; (3) read secondary critical texts in order to gain insights into interpretive approaches; (4) present their own interpretations and theses to their classmates; (5) listen to their classmates’ contributions and provide useful, substantive criticism; (6) explore and develop their own interpretations and formal arguments in writing, through both ungraded informal exercises and formal graded papers.</p>
<p><strong>EC-2:</strong> Students will be instructed in the conventions of formal English writing on the humanities through readings, lectures, discussions, and practice in peer editing. They will be graded on the correctness and clarity of their prose, on the relevance and persuasiveness of their interpretive theses, and on the use of evidence in support of their theses. Students complete a variety of formal and informal writing exercises, including reading responses to primary readings, reviews and summaries of secondary readings, bibliographical entries, research papers, and a variety of in-class and take-home exercises. Students are expected to compose all writing assignments using word-processing software, to learn the conventions of writing in MLA style, and to avail themselves of electronic and in-library tools for research in the humanities (a library visit will be required to train students in how to access and use these sources). Students will engage in several written and oral peer- and self-critiques.</p>
<p><strong>EC-3:</strong> Students will undertake close-readings of both primary sources (literary works, films, recordings, reproductions of visual art) and critical secondary texts. Students will spend one class meeting at the library with the instructor in order to learn how to access and use electronic databases and locate hard-copy sources of secondary critical texts. Students will be given a common set of secondary readings to discuss in class and will be required to find at least one additional secondary source for their research papers. Students will analyze the form, content, and context of each primary source and the thesis of each secondary critical reading. For instance, they may be asked to discuss and write about how the argument/plot, character, setting, voice, style, genre, and context of primary literary texts are construed and developed, and how they relate to each other. Informal and in-class writing activities will focus on summarizing and interpreting primary texts. Formal and at-home writing assignments will require students to discuss at least one secondary source in order to contextualize their close reading and interpretation of the primary source(s). In research essays, students will synthesize both primary and secondary sources to answer a research question, and situate their own argument in relation to those of the secondary source(s) used.</p>
<p><strong>EC-4:</strong> This course devotes considerable class discussion time, readings, and formal and informal writing assignments to the form and content of texts, broken down into analyses of argument/plot, character, structure, voice, genre, style, and context among other elements. Students are expected to articulate their own interpretations of the texts both orally and in writing for their peers, as well as in formal prose appropriate to both a general and academic audience.</p>
<p><strong>EC-5:</strong> Class time and discussion of secondary critical texts are devoted to the purpose and methods of ethical attribution and citation, and students receive regular feedback on their progress in meeting these standards in subsequent formal and informal writing. In both thesis-driven research essays and interpretation of primary sources and secondary critical texts, students must articulate original ideas, support them with textual evidence and logical reasoning, and accurately cite all sources. Students explain and defend their theses orally and through peer-reviewed writing. Through the research papers, students formally situate their own interpretations of the primary literary or cultural texts within a “conversation” made up of scholarly sources about their chosen topic, whose arguments students must distill fairly and accurately.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-3:</strong> Students regularly discuss readings, write informal responses to the readings, read (in class and at home) and react to their own and other students’ work, and work on drafts of formal work orally and through exercises, critiques, and several rounds of revision. Class discussions of secondary critical texts focus in part on how these texts approach one of more themes in the primary text(s), build a thesis about them, and succeed or fail to persuade readers through argumentation and the use of textual evidence.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-2:</strong> The course prepares students for the formal interpretive- and thesis-driven writing that is expected in other humanities courses, as well as for the kind of formal, persuasive, non-fiction writing required in most professions, helping them to succeed in life and contribute to society beyond their college educations. Students will be assigned at least 20 pages of formal, graded writing, and at least one such assignment will require revision.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-1:</strong> Students complete a variety of formal and informal writing exercises, including reading responses to primary readings, reviews and summaries of secondary readings, bibliographical entries, research papers, and a variety of in-class and take-home exercises. Students are expected to compose all writing assignments using word-processing software, and will be instructed in the conventions of writing in MLA style. With the instructor’s assistance, students will avail themselves of electronic and in-library tools for research in the humanities (a library visit will be required to train students in how to access and use these sources). Students will engage in several written and oral peer- and self-critiques of their writing.</p>

<h3 id="EC-2HIST190">HIST 190 Writing and History [EC]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-01-25</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> This history course relies mostly on textual evidence, interpreted primarily through close readings. Historical questions generally address cause and effect and/or change or continuity over time. In this course, students read a variety of primary and secondary texts on a (variable) topic, and through a series of assignments perform close readings of primary sources, and then use secondary sources to frame an original research question and to contextualize primary sources.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> This course builds on basic English composition by applying basic skills of reading, writing and argument to specific historical questions, and by practicing asking and answering specifically historical questions (about cause/effect or continuity/change) through readings, discussion, and formal and informal writing assignments. The course prepares students for the formal argument-based writing that will be expected in history and other social sciences courses, as well as for the kind of formal, persuasive, non-fiction writing required in most professions, helping students to succeed and contribute beyond their college educations.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> Throughout the course, students are expected to (1) read academic and historical texts and take notes on them in specific analytical categories, (2) discuss these readings in class, with particular attention to how arguments are constructed and how they succeed or fail, (3) present their own interpretations and arguments to their classmates, (4) listen to their classmates’ work and provide useful, substantive criticism, (5) explore and develop their own interpretations and formal arguments in writing, first through ungraded exercises and then formal, graded papers.</p>
<p><strong>EC-2:</strong> Students will be instructed in the expectations of formal English through readings, lectures, discussions, and exercises, and graded on the correctness and clarity of their prose. Students are assigned formal and informal writing in several genres, including but not limited to: primary source interpretation, annotated bibliography or historiographical essay, research essay, and a variety of in-class and take-home exercises. Students are expected to compose all this writing using word processing software, and to access at least 4 electronic databases most used for historical research (a library visit will be required, to train students in how to access and use these sources). Students will engage in several written and oral peer- and self-critiques.</p>
<p><strong>EC-3:</strong> Students will choose appropriate primary and secondary sources to explore first a close-reading of one primary source, and then to answer a more general research question using primary and secondary sources. Students will spend a class day at the library learning how to access and use electronic databases and locate hardcopy sources. Students will be required to find several sources for their research papers and analyze the argument of each one, as well as how the arguments of each source relate to each other, and to the student’s own research goal. In primary source essays, students use one or two secondary sources to contextualize a close reading of the primary source. In research essays, students synthesize both primary and secondary sources to answer a research question, and situate their own argument in relation to those of secondary sources.</p>
<p><strong>EC-4:</strong> This course devotes considerable class time, as well as readings and formal and informal assignments, to the nature and structure of historical arguments, broken down into thesis or main claim, evidence, and reasoning (or warrants), as well as qualifications and counter-arguments. Students are expected to articulate their own arguments orally and in writing, for their peers as well as in formal prose appropriate to both a general and academic audience.</p>
<p><strong>EC-5:</strong> Class time and readings are devoted to the purpose and methods of ethical attribution and citation, and students receive regular feedback on their progress in meeting these standards in subsequent formal and informal writing. In both a research essay and primary source interpretation, students must articulate original ideas, and support them with textual evidence and logical reasoning. Students explain and defend their ideas with their peers, and in the research essay formally situate their own argument within a “conversation” made up of scholarly sources, whose arguments students must distill fairly and accurately.</p>

<h3 id="EC-2LIBR170">LIBR 170 Writing and Library Research Methods [EC]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-06-13</h4>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> Students will analyze readings in order to understand how sources are used to provide evidence of claims.  One of the course readings is explicitly intended to give them a framework from which to understand this, and the course includes an assignment for which they will articulate how a specific piece of academic writing uses sources to support a claim. An annotated bibliography will also be used to allow students to clearly explain the reasoning behind their own choice of sources.</p>
<p><strong>EC-2:</strong> Students will compile an annotated bibliography, write a substantial research paper, and submit several low-stakes writing assignments which will help to hone their writing skills. In their other assignments, they will work in other genres, such as including reference articles and analyses of sources used in scholarly articles; other course topics might include other genres of writing. The class will include revision workshops and blogs, which will give students an opportunity both to critique and to revise.</p>
<p><strong>EC-3:</strong> Research is the central focus of the course. Students will gather and evaluate sources in support of their claims, and will learn to integrate these sources into their writing through several writing assignments, including the final research paper. The sources used will be of various types and students will learn which sources are appropriate for various writing tasks.</p>
<p><strong>EC-4:</strong> The course culminates in a research paper in which the student will need to make a claim and support it, integrating information they have gathered for their annotated bibliography with their own arguments. Other assignments throughout the course will require students to write in different genres and for different audiences.</p>
<p><strong>EC-5:</strong> Students will master the appropriate citation format in the course of writing the annotated bibliography. They will also have many opportunities to see how other authors provide attribution and will, of course, use appropriate citation practices in their own writing.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-3:</strong> Students will keep blogs and be required to submit low-stakes writing assignments. In-class writing exercises will be used throughout the course to teach specific aspects of writing.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-2:</strong> The syllabus provided here requires a 3-page reflection on editing Wikipedia, a 3-4 page analysis of the use of sources in an academic article, a 1-2 page research proposal, a 5 page annotated bibliography, and an 8-10 page research paper, for a total of 20-24 pages of formal writing. Although the assignments may vary slightly with different topics, there will always be an equivalent amount of writing. In the current syllabus, all the assignments are revised.  The final research paper will always require revision, regardless of the course’s topic.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-1:</strong> In-class writing exercises, a course vocabulary, revision workshops, and discussion of rhetorical choices made in the readings will be used to instruct students in writing.</p>

<h3 id="EC-2MUSIC121">MUSIC 121 Writing about Music [EC]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-06-13</h4>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> The readings for this course have been carefully chosen and spaced in order to provide students with exemplary literature and ample time to discuss the material in class. The trajectory through the semester, including in-class and out-of-class written assignments have been designed to facilitate the development of a listening techne and sophisticated vocabulary with which to articulate a critical and multi-layered assessment of musical sound and associated meaning.</p>
<p><strong>EC-2:</strong> The major assignments for this class utilise a variety of written genres (including direct description, ethnographic narrative, the concert review and the historical essay). In addition, students will complete a variety of low-stakes written work in class.</p>
<p><strong>EC-3:</strong> The final assignment for this class includes a significant research component. This is proceeded by a carefully scaffolded sequence of preliminary assignments that introduce a variety of means to collect information on specific musical sounds.</p>
<p><strong>EC-4:</strong> This class foregrounds the use of sound and musical material as evidence. Class discussion and a variety of written exercises will give students practice at formulating theses in relationship to sounding matter, and the readings used to support the classwork exemplify the integration of argument, context, and musical material.</p>
<p><strong>EC-5:</strong> Through a sustained interaction with exemplary musicological scholarship, this class emphasises the position of the scholar as a participant in an ongoing academic conversation. Citation practice will be discussed in class and bibliographic technique will be reviewed in relationship to each assignment.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-3:</strong> A large number of in-class writing assignments are required for this class, and are detailed in the syllabus.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-2:</strong> Formal drafts are required for both assignment 2 and assignment 4. Revision techniques will be covered in class and elements of student work will be workshopped.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-1:</strong> This syllabus structures writing instruction into the very fabric of the course outline. This class was developed in conjunction with the Writing at Queens program.</p>

<h3 id="EC-2MUSIC122">MUSIC 122 Writing Musical Culture [EC]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-06-13</h4>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> The readings for this course have been carefully chosen in order to present cutting-edge musicological research and engaging methodologies. At the same time, they have been limited to one per week in order to give the students time to engage with sophisticated, complex arguments, and to allow discussion of rhetoric and argument during class periods.</p>
<p><strong>EC-2:</strong> The written assignments for this class include historical and ethnographic research methods—the two major avenues of musicological scholarship.</p>
<p><strong>EC-3:</strong> The scaffolded assignments of this course require students to apply a variety of research skills: assignment two is an historical question, assignment three requires students to visit and observe a contemporary community, and assignment four necessitates a deepening and development of one of the earlier assignments. Students are taught the skills to generate bibliographic material that will sustain their written work. Through in-class workshops and discussion we will refine techniques of synthesis and citation.</p>
<p><strong>EC-4:</strong> The structured assignment sequence of this course helps students understand the  discursive constraints of different written genres. Students will learn the types of arguments that can be made from different research techniques and materials, crafting their theses accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>EC-5:</strong> The readings chosen for this course emphasise the dialectical nature of the academic conversation. Through the selection of high-quality academic writing as exemplars (rather than tertiary, or text-book, sources), the conventions of the scholarly conventions are brought into focus. In-class discussion will emphasise the importance of accurate citation practice and students will work with their own citations and those of their peers in order to develop health citation practices.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-3:</strong> A large number of in-class writing assignments are required for this class, and are detailed in the syllabus.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-2:</strong> Revision is factored into this syllabus as a major structural feature of the assignment sequence.

<h3 id="EC-2SOC190">SOC 190 Writing for Sociology [EC]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-04-19</h4>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> This course is concerned with “what constitutes a good explanation in sociology.” Students work closely with diverse sociological texts, and the course focuses on various research methodologies and argument construction used to put forward hypotheses and support conclusions.  
Students analyze materials to learn both how academic sources speak and conventions for integrating various perspectives into their own arguments.</p>
<p><strong>EC-2:</strong> The course concentrates on five types of assignments: 
•	Evaluating a published research article,
•	Writing an annotated bibliography,
•	Critiquing drafts written by classmates during writing workshops,
•	Writing a Literature Review, and
•	Writing a Social Issue Paper.</p>
<p><strong>EC-3:</strong> Students use both primary and secondary sources to investigate research topics. Students are encouraged to collect material from a variety of sources and must evaluate the quality of both the sources of information and the readings themselves.  In this process, students will become familiar with on-line databases that provide tools for writing and for gathering sociological research.</p>
<p><strong>EC-4:</strong> By reading and summarizing journal articles, students learn to model their analysis and the development of their arguments on published sociological material. Writing in the discipline of Sociology requires a working knowledge of the discipline’s vocabulary, which they learn through assigned readings, evaluating articles, and reviewing research for their respective reports and papers.  Through class presentations on their own writing, students learn how to translate their ideas from paper to “live” discussion.</p>
<p><strong>EC-5:</strong> This class teaches students academic conventions of citation as well as how to use existing arguments and research in support of one’s own. Students are taught the basic rules for APA style with a particular emphasis on ethical attribution.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-1:</strong> EC-2.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-2:</strong> None.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>CW2-3:</strong> Students will complete in-class writing exercises such as critiquing student drafts and brief responses to readings.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-2:</strong> Students will complete at least 20 pages of formal, graded writing:  An annotated bibliography (5 pages), a literature review (8 pages), and a Social Issues Paper (10 pages).  Both the literature review and the Social Issues Paper will require revision through the submission of drafts and  critique in the writing workshops.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-1:</strong> Instructions on writing will be supplied through lecture, the textbook (a guideline for writing in the discipline), peer feedback, and instructor review of drafts.</p>
<h3 id="EC-2URBST120">URBST 120 Writing in Urban Studies [EC]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-12-18</h4>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> In the first three weeks, students read closely and critically several articles in the area of urban studies. They prepare analytical summaries of these articles, analyzing their relation to each other and to the discipline.</p>
<p><strong>EC-2:</strong> Students prepare two 4-6 page writing assignments, one summarizing and analyzing several articles in the area of urban studies, the other comparing and contrasting several articles in this area. They then prepare a 15-page research paper. All of this writing is reviewed and analyzed in class and subject to multiple re-drafting.</p>
<p><strong>EC-3:</strong> Students will learn and exercise their research skills in the course on finding and assimilating sources for their assignments and their research paper. Students also receive training from Queens College Library faculty in optimal use of library and online resources.</p>
<p><strong>EC-4:</strong> Students will develop a thesis with data and arguments in the course of preparing a 15-page research paper.</p>
<p><strong>EC-5:</strong> The course will emphasize the importance of full and appropriate citation for all sources used in preparing research papers. Both the two writing assignments and research paper will incorporate this experience.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-3:</strong> Students will be required to take clear and complete notes and utilize these in preparing their two writing assignments and their research paper. Students will learn to do fastwrites, double-entry journaling, and summaries of non-academic sources such as films.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-2:</strong> Students will write more than 20 pages of research-based material including their two assignments and their research paper. All of these will be subject to multiple reviews and revision.</p>
<p><strong>CW2-1:</strong> Students will receive continuing instruction in writing in the course of preparing, reviewing, and revising their assignments and research paper.</p>

<h3 id="LPSASTR3">ASTR 3 Introductory Astronomy with Laboratory [LP SCI]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-06-17</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> This course uses three venues for the disbursement of knowledge each with a mechanism for students to respond and reinforce their level of knowledge acquisition.  The traditional lecture component has quizzes called attendance quizzes that are similar to questions that will later appear on midterm and final exams.  In addition SkyGazer Planetarium software which is used in the second laboratory of the semester has a number of animation applications such as animations of the earth circling the sun and how the tilt of earth’s rotation axis causes the seasons.  Homework which is assigned through the online website MasteringAstronomy.com has extensive tutorials that go over material introduced in the lectures.  The laboratory as the third major part of the course uses certain experiments from Fred J. Cadieu, General Astronomy Laboratory Experiments which have been made available on Blackboard.  In addition astronomy observing sessions are made available for observing the major planets such as Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, and the Sun.  Students are expected to submit a written report on one observing session during the semester.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Since the development of modern astronomy was essentially the development of modern science, we believe it is the best course to introduce students to the wonders of modern science and the importance of the scientific method.  Central to our understanding are certain concepts such as the constancy and extremal value of the speed of light, the best known equation in the world, E = m c squared, and many other exotic concepts such as Black Holes as first envisioned by Einstein.  As a testament to how our attitudes and world view was changed by these and other discoveries, it should be noted that Time Magazine named Albert Einstein “Person of the 20th Century”.</p>
<p><strong>LPS-1:</strong> Throughout this course it is shown how experimental evidence has shaped and changed our views of the physical world.  A prime example that first showed the primacy of physical data was when Kepler plotted the data collected and tabulated by Tycho Brahe over about a 3 decade period to show that the true shape of the planetary orbits were ellipses and not circles as previously always assumed.  Newton made a tremendous advance when he applied the same physical laws that could be tested here on earth to the moon, sun, and surrounding stars and then made predictions that could be tested by observations.  Applications of Newton’s laws made the industrial revolution possible.  Numerous examples abound throughout the course.  Our very use of the light year as a distance scale for star and galaxy size distances depends on the speed of light being a special maximum speed and the same for all the different wavelengths of light in the vacuum of space.  It is shown that modern scientific models should make testable predictions that then refine and advance our understanding of the physical world.</p>
<p><strong>LPS-2:</strong> The lectures present many cases in which data obtained from visual and telescope observations, space probes, and laboratory experiments have been used to formulate and test scientific hypotheses.
Seven two hour labs have been planned for this course.  The laboratory experiments give the students hands on experience in performing observations, making measurements, plotting data, analyzing data to get an answer to a specific hypothesis, and testing whether the results obtained are reasonable.  Lab #1 uses observations and measurements made on a scale model Moon Globe to determine distances, locate lunar objects in terms of latitude and longitude measurements, and compare crater differences between the side of the moon facing toward the earth to that on the side that always faces away from the earth. These questions relate to different hypotheses about how and when the moon formed.  The second lab uses SkyGazer planetarium software to study the path of the sun and moon across the sky and to predict when and why solar and lunar eclipses may be observed.  The third deals with locating stars and constellations on the celestial sphere.  This is a basic lab that deals with the constellations that can be seen at different times of the year, the ecliptic path of the sun, and celestial sphere coordinates.  The fourth experiment gives an introduction to telescope measurements treating such topics as measuring the field of view, magnification, and resolution for refracting and reflecting telescopes.  One lab uses computer simulated equipment for measuring the surface temperatures of stars and hypotheses relating the Sun’s temperature to the temperatures of the planets Venus, earth, and mars.  The lab shows the importance of greenhouse effects in determining a planet’s surface temperature.  The seventh lab uses computer simulations of spectra measurements for determining the speed of galaxies as a function of distance.   The students then plot the measurements for which the graph slope then gives a value of Hubble’s Constant.  The reciprocal of the Hubble Constant then yield a proposed age of the universe.  This lab addresses the basic hypothesis of the universe expansion which is at the heart of the big bang model.</p>
<p><strong>LPS-3:</strong> Most labs are done in pairs using moon globe models, celestial spheres, telescopes, and in some cases computer simulations of pieces of equipment that would be far too expensive to purchase for introductory laboratories.  Generally measurements are used to test some scientific concept or hypothesis.  Sometimes class averages are computed so that students can compare the accuracy of their measurements to that of the class as a whole.</p>

This lab addresses the basic hypothesis of the universe expansion which is at the heart of the big bang model.
Before each lab students are expected to print out and read the lab notes as posted on Blackboard.  The lab notes contain equipment descriptions, procedures, data sheets and graph templates, and questions related to the laboratory.  In some cases class average values will be computed to see if individual student, or pairs of students values fall within 1 or 2 sigma of the class average value.
In addition an observer’s report from one of the observing sessions will be used for student’s to describe their impressions for example of seeing Jupiter complete with moons for the 1st time.</p>
<p><strong>LPS-5:</strong> Throughout this course it is shown how applications of the scientific method have led to advancements in not only knowledge but advancements in understanding that have led to further new questions.  Theories and models that are not supported by experiment are overturned and replaced by new theories that are consistent with experiment.  Throughout it is shown that measurements must have a certain range of repeatability and confidence which then test hypotheses. The repeatability of results by independent researchers will be stressed as the basis of scientific ethics.  Students directly see this in some of the labs where individual student values can be compared to class averages.  The students then can appreciate how properly worded hypotheses can be supported or contradicted by unbiased measurements. 

This course is a variation of Astronomy 2 – a Perspectives NS + L Area of Knowledge approved course – to conform to the Pathways Life and Physical Sciences course requirements.  Some lecture material and laboratories have been removed to change the course from 4 credits to 3 credits.

<h3 id="LPSBIOL14">BIOL 14 Introduction to Biology and Society [LP SCI]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-06-11</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Information presented in lectures and labs is integrated and designed to complement each other. Basic ideas and background of the subject being explored are presented in lectures and then those concepts are integrated in the laboratory situation.   Students make observations of the subject under consideration - sometimes having living and prepared biological materials available for observation and experiments, other occasions from readings, or video segments, or computer simulations.  From observations students will develop questions and prepare hypotheses and alternative hypotheses as possible answers to those questions.  During lab 1, for example, data are recorded, questions asked, hypotheses developed and then tested using and statistical analyses to demonstrate the scientific process.  In another lab, growing fungal cultures and making crosses will yield data allowing students to estimate the distance between two gene loci on a chromosome, a hands-on exploration of questions fundamental to the understanding of heritability.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> The design of the course is reflected in its title: Biology and Society.  Clearly, we see historical evidence of the use of technology before there was any understanding of the underlying science, e.g., breeding agricultural crops and domestication of animals. Also, the sophisticated development of irrigation systems in pre-scientific cultures was successful without any knowledge of the science.  After exploring the development of science as a discipline, we intend to examine how our understanding of biological science is reflected in just about every aspect of our lives.  How are we impacted, constrained, molded, and controlled by biology?   (Think: the human genome project!)</p>
<p><strong>LPS-1:</strong> In any discipline, before concepts and their application can be practiced, the students must be exposed to the fundamentals of the subject and the vocabulary that accompanies understanding.  This will be imparted in lecture with a subsequent application in the laboratory.  We will begin with observations and questions that stem from those observations.  Students then are asked to try to establish possible answers to those questions and approaches that might be attempted to examine those ideas.  Then, an important aspect in this process arises, and that is how does one decide whether a possible answer to a falsifiable hypothesis should be rejected or sustained for further testing because it was not falsified.  The goal here is to reinforce the idea that in science we can never prove that an idea is true, but we can only sustain an idea as long as it is not falsified.  Only after exhaustive reexaminations and inordinate testing may a hypothesis attain the status of a theory.</p>
<p><strong>LPS-2:</strong> Each laboratory session employs the process of science.  Several labs involve biological measurements, culturing, making genetic crosses, and testing using statistical methods, connecting ideas from observations from a video and melding these with fundamental approaches in the study of ecology.  Other labs sessions involve seeking answers to questions using guided searches on the internet, utilizing such sites as the US Census Bureau; NYC.gov; USDA, Economic Research Service; WWF Living Planet Report; CIS World Fact Book, and others, then compiling data, analyzing those data and presenting them in various formats such as tables, graphs and diagrams.  Lab reports are graded.</p>
<p><strong>LPS-3:</strong> As above, in laboratory sessions students are required to work in pairs or larger groups in the gathering of data and the execution of its analysis.  Comparison of results by different groups is part of this learning process.</p>
<p><strong>LPS-4:</strong> Lab reports - brief descriptions of the aim of the session, the techniques used in executing the work, the data and its analysis, and the interpretation and conclusions are part of the laboratory experience.  In several respects, these laboratories and their reports complement the essays that will be assigned on several assorted lecture-laboratory topics.</p>
<p><strong>LPS-5:</strong> Much of modern human related biology is controversial and has ethical considerations - particularly in the areas of genetics, genomics, stem cells, cloning, GM crops, assisted reproductive technologies, chemicals in the environment and hormone disrupters, infectious disease vectors, economics of ecosystem services, and even aging and diet.  These topics should easily provide a full exposure to major ethical quandaries facing our society - including the so-called hegemony of science.</p>

<h3 id="LPSENSCI99">ENSCI 99 A Practical Guide to Environmental Choices [LP SCI]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-11-11</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Environmental science aims to gain knowledge on the workings of the earth’s surficial environment that has been subjected to considerable modifications by human beings.  Through multi-disciplinary observation, experimentation, data analysis and modeling efforts, questions that lead to hypotheses are derived and then answered most commonly through deductive reasoning.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Nature, or the environment, has stimulated the most important thoughts of philosophers and scientists since ancient times.  Human impact on the environment has accelerated since the industrial revolution.  Concerned by adverse health effects on human and ecosystem from pollution, citizens have initiated and engaged in the environmental protection that has led to the improvement of air and water quality in our nation.  Today, society is confronted by the challenges of anthropogenic climate change, an issue that has global impact but requires local actions.  Therefore, environmental science has been and remains at the forefront of liberal arts thinking that will guide society towards a sustainable development for better living standards worldwide.  This course will help prepare our students to participate as informed citizens in the debates on environmental issues.</p>
<p><strong>LPS-1:</strong> Two 1.5-hr lectures in one week combined with a 3-hr laboratory in another week are organized as one unit to seek answers to a specific question that will require the students to learn and apply the basic concepts of Environmental Science.  The lecture will primarily be used to guide the students through the process of asking and defining questions based on existing knowledge.  The laboratory will primarily be used to guide the students to establish possible answers to these questions.  An important aspect in this process is to examine how assumptions, or the different choices we make in our daily lives, affect the answers.  The goal here is to introduce the idea that there is often more than one answer or solution to most environmental problems.</p>
<p><strong>LPS-2:</strong> Fourteen 1.5-hour lectures have been planned for this course that will highlight the process of hypothesis formulation in the scientific method.  For example, observations of real time air and water quality data can be used to begin the process of hypothesis development. The last topic to be presented in the lecture is a hot topic of concern. At present, it is hydraulic fracking to extract shale gas. 

Seven 3-hour laboratory sessions have been planned for this course.  The first laboratory exercise introduces the scientific method.  Three labs involve air and water quality measurements.  Two more labs sessions involve estimation of carbon emission at personal and communal levels, and to begin a quantitative assessment of how greenhouse gases affect the temperature of the Earth through a simple energy balance model. A final lab session will be a debate on a current controversial environmental topic. The laboratory sessions give the students hands on experience in performing observations, making measurements, plotting data, analyzing data to test a specific hypothesis, and to test whether the results obtained are reasonable.  Lab reports are graded.</p>
<p><strong>LPS-3:</strong> Students will use a variety of environmental monitoring tools to make measurements and to conduct experiments and data analysis in groups or small teams. Comparison of results by different groups is part of this learning process.</p>
<p><strong>LPS-4:</strong> Students will submit individual lab reports. Each report is to have a brief description of the aim, the methods used in executing the work, the data and its analysis, the interpretation and discussion of the limitation of the data analysis, and conclusions.  At least three laboratory sessions will involve sampling and/or analysis of air and water samples. A brief description of the field settings is also applicable.</p>
<p><strong>LPS-5:</strong> Laboratory sessions will be an opportunity for students to assess the validity of the experimental data. Reports will demonstrate how the data collection process or the assumptions in study design will introduce inherent bias in scientific data or data interpretation.  Students will learn the ethical approach to interpret such data despite of its limitations.</p>

In this course, students will practice these skills through preparatory work online, be provided examples in lecture presentations, and apply these skills in hand-on laboratory activities</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Geology has a long history as a prominent part of the liberal arts and sciences curriculum, from the insights on how sediments are deposited by Steno (17th century) through 18th century pioneers like Hutton, who introduced uniformitarianism and Smith, who created the first geologic map.  More recent thinkers, like Darwin on evolution, Agassiz on glaciation, Wegener and Hess on plate tectonics in the 20th century, have transformed how humans understand our origins and ancient planet, and how the planet has transformed over time.

Geology has played a critical role in the evolution of human civilization, as witnessed by the common terminology for stages in that evolution: Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age. Understanding the Earth is more critical than ever as new resources are needed for new inventions, more energy is needed for a growing population, and the expanding human population is moving into places which will, predictably if one knows geologic processes, lead to natural disasters</p>
<p><strong>LPS-1:</strong> Students will learn the basic concepts of Geology and apply them immediately to the needs of modern society. Examples include Units 2, 3, and 4 of the syllabus.</p>
<p><strong>LPS-2:</strong> Laboratory and online activities will emphasize the scientific method. Students will identify problems, propose hypotheses and acquire and assess the data to test these hypotheses. The overaching theories in geology exemplify this approach: for example, the evolution of Wegner’s hypothesis of continental drift to what we now know as the theory of Plate Tectonics (How the Earth Works)</p>
<p><strong>LPS-3:</strong> Students will use unique geologic tools and reasoning in laboratory and online exercises illustrate develop concepts learned in lecture and solve real-world problems. Laboratory exercises require students to work in small teams each week. Examples are found in all units in all 14 weeks of the semester.</p>
<p><strong>LPS-4:</strong> Reports outlining the scientific approach and research findings will be required each week. Written lab homework and online assignments will help students develop skills in  data analysis and interpretation. Again, this type of exercise will be required each week.</p>
<p><strong>LPS-5:</strong> Online research assignments and homework will be an opportunity for students to explore several sources of data and to assess their validity. Reports will demonstrate how the data were applied, focusing on a balanced, unbiased approach. There are numerous examples, most notably in Unit 5 analysis of predicting natural disasters and mitigating damages.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-1:</strong> None at the moment. It is designed solely for Pathways requirements and is not a gateway course for Geology, Environmental Science, or Environmental Studies.

Other majors may adopt it as an elective or required course. Potential departments include Urban Studies; Sociology; Economics.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-2:</strong> None</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-3:</strong> Anticipated laboratory sections of 20, combined in lecture sections of 100-300.</p>
<h3 id="LPSPSYCH252">PSYCH 252 Application of Behavior Analysis in Animal Training [LP SCI]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-02-25</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> The goal is to apply the science of behavior in producing and analyzing changes in behavior. Students will study behavior as a natural science in which hypotheses, based on established principles, are systematically tested, and where answers can be quantified, verified and replicated. 

Students will: 1) learn to operationally define dependent variables (e.g., “the animal subject learns to discriminate between a large and small circle”); 2) identify the relevant principles of behavior control (e.g., presentation of food—reinforcement—following responses to the correct stimulus—a large circle—strengthens that response, while responding to the incorrect, small circle is weakened by non-reinforcement); 3) develop testable hypotheses regarding effects of parametric manipulation of teaching procedures (e.g., strengthening responding to the correct, large circle prior to introduction of the incorrect, small circle will produce faster discrimination learning, in comparison to introducing both the correct and incorrect stimuli simultaneously; 4) design an experiment to test the hypothesis; 5) design data-collection and analysis procedures; and 5) prepare the data-based findings for dissemination to other members of the class.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> The science of behavior expands our understanding of human behavior using experimentation to identify laws specifying the relation between past events and future action. Theories of behavior have emerged from and exist within intellectual contexts such as philosophy, biology and psychiatry. These fields also focus on the nature of behavior but rely on diverse approaches. The science of behavior can speak to these alternative disciplines and can grow as a field by attempting to analyze phenomena not typically addressed by other behavior theories.

An understanding of basic learning principles can have far reaching effects. Students who learn behavior analysis and its practical application become aware of how the environment affects behavior. The planned course focuses on students’ understanding how to change the behavior of another living being by changing their own behavior. Students must find ways to teach the animal by applying basic learning principles, without the use of force, and to evaluate their success. Students learn to observe and quantify behavior objectively, including their own behavior, and how to apply learning principles to change behavior.</p>
<p><strong>LPS-1:</strong> The science of behavior analysis is guided by principles that have been shown to accurately predict and control behavior. Students will study the principles of behavior and the research methodology by which they are applied. Rather than simply learning about principles and methods, students will have regular opportunities to apply them in analysis of a given behavioral repertoire. The principles of behavior are amply described in a number of textbooks on learning and behavior analysis, including the one that will be assigned.</p>
<p><strong>LPS-2:</strong> The course gives students an opportunity to gain a working knowledge of behavior as a natural, lawful phenomenon. Research methodology will focus on the within-subject design where each individual studied provides data under different levels of the independent variable. The conditions under which inferences can be drawn regarding the effects of experimental procedures will be discussed on a regular basis. 

Students will: 1) learn to operationally define dependent variables (e.g., “the animal subject learns to discriminate between a large and small circle”); 2) identify the relevant principles of behavior control (e.g., presentation of food—reinforcement—following responses to the correct stimulus—a large circle—strengthens that response, while responding to the incorrect, small circle is weakened by non-reinforcement); 3) develop testable hypotheses regarding effects of parametric manipulation of teaching procedures (e.g., strengthening responding to the correct, large circle prior to introduction of the incorrect, small circle will produce faster discrimination learning, in comparison to introducing both the correct and incorrect stimuli simultaneously; 4) design an experiment to test the hypothesis; 5) design data-collection and analysis procedures; and 5) prepare the data-based findings for dissemination to other members of the class.</p>
<p><strong>LPS-3:</strong> In every training session, the student is confronted with how to effect behavior change and he or she must try to isolate the variables that are affecting behavior change. During lab, students will work in pairs, with each student alternating between training the animal and serving as coach to their partner. This allows the instructor to carry the discipline of objective observation and analysis to the students’ behavior. The instructor will guide the students on how to help each other improve their training skills by observing one another. Class discussion provides time for students to critically discuss data from their observations and to discuss what further research design might be used to support a cause-and-effect relationship between the environment and behavior.</p>
<p><strong>LPS-4:</strong> Students will keep a training log, which is a written report that details the goal and progress of each training session, including: operational definition of training goals; a breakdown of the successive approximations toward the goal; the duration of each training session; number of trials per session; number of correct and incorrect responses; etc. Students will be required to document their training plans and resulting data, and present same during in-class discussions on what they are doing and why. When hypothesis testing is conducted, students will be guided in planning a systematic method of manipulating an independent variable. They will identify the data required to test their hypotheses, including the method of data display.</p>
<p><strong>LPS-5:</strong> Students will study the principles governing ethical treatment of laboratory animals, including factors relating to housing, handling, deprivation, number of animals studied, and treatment of animals after the research is concluded.

One of the most important goals of this course is to teach students to examine behavior objectively. Students will be taught to put aside pre-conceived ideas about “why” the animal is behaving in a particular way and instead to observe and collect information about behavior objectively. By doing this, they will be able to make logical decisions about what they must do to get the animal to emit the target behaviors. As a result of the laboratory work, the students will understand how the animal’s behavioral repertoire was moved from what it was at baseline to performance of the final behavior. This is the main emphasis of the laboratory work.</p>

<p><strong>QC-2:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives SS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> This course is taught entirely from primary sources.  The document source book provides both written and visual records; the students are also required to view selected films and to assess
whether or not it validly interprets documents they have studied.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> The students are required to do written
analyses of 20 documents.  Criteria for
doing document analyses is provided in
the syllabus</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Class participation is worth 15% of the
final grade.  In addition to the written
analyses and film essay mentioned
above, a comprehensive take-home
essay which must be based on
documentary evidence is worth 50% of
the grade for the final exam</p>
<p><strong>US-1:</strong> The historical method–analysis of
documentary evidence–is an integral
part of the course and syllabus for
H103.  History 103 comprehends the
experience of Native Americans,
Hispanics, Europeans and Africans.</p>
<p><strong>US-2:</strong> The sources on the American
Revolution (patriot vs. loyalist); labor
systems (indentured service, slavery,
female and child labor, and  “wage
slavery” ); and Indian removal are three
of many examples where students are
asked to analyze and explain major
themes in U. S. History.</p>
<p><strong>US-3:</strong> The history of the United States until
1865 is in large part a history of the
immigration of Europeans and Africans.
The first sources studied compare the
initial encounters of Europeans with
Native Americans and chart the decline
of the Native American population and
contrasts it with the increased numbers
of non-Indian peoples.</p>
<p><strong>US-4:</strong> The 17  and 18  centuries were times th th
when European nations were contesting
for empire in North America and
elsewhere.  This contest generated
colonial dissatisfaction with the British
Empire and resulted in the American
Revolution.  United States expansion
generated conflicts with the British and
Spanish Empires and with Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>US-5:</strong> he course documents the founders’ understanding that the Articles of Confederation did not provide for the essential functions of a true government, and their determination to establish and separate the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the government, to provide checks and balances among them, and to enunciate that the Supreme Court had the power of judicial review.</p>
<p><strong>US-6:</strong> The course focuses significant attention on ordinary citizens, their religions, the gender, labor and racial institutions that shaped their lives, and the modification of social structures during the period covered by the course (1492-1865).</p>

<p><strong>QC-2:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives SS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Class discussions of regular weekly reading assignments, representing a variety of perspectives, help hone students’ skills of evaluation, argumentation, and critical analysis. Weekly in-class analyses of assigned primary sources––ranging from political cartoons, diary entries, newspaper coverage and comic strips to contemporary song lyrics and motion picture clips––illuminate key points of the reading from a number of sometimes contrasting points of view.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> In addition to the types of primary sources listed above (the pieces of “evidence” students are encouraged to probe for their inherent biases, and for the ways they reveal the attitudes and values of their times), students’ reading of secondary sources allows them to recognize theses, arguments, and point of view, and to evaluate these against the primary evidence they have examined.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Two written assignments as well as two exams provide an opportunity for students to display their insights in detail. Group work and presentations further develop their ability to present, argue, and debate history.</p>
<p><strong>US-1:</strong> The course emphasizes the “historical method” – students are encouraged to draw their conclusions based on an immersion into the primary sources of the period; to look for commonalities as well as contrasts as they compare such sources; and to assess them within the context of the secondary readings assigned. In addition, this survey course emphasizes chronology, which hones students’ awareness of cause and effect. Furthermore, transcending mere chronology, the course also engages a thematic approach, re-visiting themes such as racial, gender, and class inequality; the role of government in the lives of Americans; and the use of American power abroad, as these and other such themes develop over time (for specific examples, see below).</p>
<p><strong>US-2:</strong> Virtually all recurring themes in the course are viewed from multiple, often contradictory perspectives. Examining such major themes from multiple perspectives heightens students’ awareness of their complexity––and the complexity of history itself––and helps them shape informed and nuanced views of their own.

For example: U.S. policy towards racial/ethnic/social minorities (Bureau of Indian Affairs policy, Wk. 2; immigration restriction and reform, Wks. 2, 7 and 14; Japanese-American Internment Wk. 9); use of U.S. power abroad (U.S. Rise to Global Power, Wk. 3; Atomic Bombings, Wk. 10; Vietnam, Wks. 15 /16); impact of U.S. economic policies at home and overseas (Great Depression, Wks. 7 – 8), et cetera.</p>
<p><strong>US-3:</strong> The course places particular emphasis on the experiences and contributions of minorities (see, for ex., civil rights, Wks. 4 &amp; 14), Native Americans (Wks. 1 &amp; 2), and immigrants (Wks 2, 3, 4, 7).</p>
<p><strong>US-4:</strong> The course spends much time on World Wars I &amp; II (Wks. 5 – 6 and 8 – 10, respectively) as well as other international conflicts; the course also considers the role the U.S. has played in the formation and history of international bodies such as the League of Nations, U.N., and NATO (Wks. 6 &amp; 11); and, throughout, traces the impact of American foreign and economic policies worldwide (for ex., Week 8).</p>
<p><strong>US-5:</strong> The course examines tensions between the branches of government and their resolutions at various key moments of the 19th and 20th centuries. For example, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s court packing controversy and states’ rights vs. the federal government during the civil rights era. (Weeks 8 and 14). Furthermore, the course examines the roles of all three branches of government as it traces the processes through which key government policies (such as taxes and credit rates, but also health and welfare benefits) are debated, amended, and implemented, then weighs these policies’ impact on the lives of various socioeconomic/ethnic/racial groups in American society (Weeks 3-4, 8, 14).</p>
<p><strong>US-6:</strong> The course examines both patterns of life (e.g., post-WWII suburbanization) and major American institutions (e.g., the Armed Forces, the church, marriage, and education) for the way they have impacted upon, and themselves have been impacted by race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation, and belief (Weeks 12, 13, 14, 16).</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> In addition to lectures, information is provided through weekly readings comprising primary and secondary sources that are written from a range of disciplinary perspectives. Weekly in-class discussions provide opportunities for students to discuss and analyze these materials.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Students are required to post weekly responses to assigned readings on the course blog. In these responses students are expected to engage, critique and respond to the course material. Additionally, each week two students will be responsible for “sparking” these discussions by posting an open-ended question or thought for the rest of the class.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Besides the weekly blog postings, student will produce a ten-page research paper at the end of the term constituting 20% of the final grade. Leading up to the submission of the final draft of the paper students will produce a preliminary bibliography, give a 5-7 minute oral presentation of their most interesting findings to the class, and submit a rough draft of the entire project. With instructor feedback at each of these steps students will have the opportunity to sharpen their ideas and improve their prose. Students will also be required to write take-home midterm and final exams in the form of essay responses to questions based on lectures and readings. Each of these assignments asks students to develop an argument supported by relevant evidence.</p>
<p><strong>US-1:</strong> Utilizing the historical method – i.e. observing and exploring the causes for change across time – this course examines in its various iterations, with the proposed H designation and without it, the impact of immigration on American society and its institutions. It also explores how racial, religious and ethnic groups in the US have negotiated the processes of Americanization and assimilation.</p>
<p><strong>US-2:</strong> While case studies or examples may vary, the core definition of the course as covering social and cultural history determines that students will examine immigration and race through a wide range of approaches, including scholarly insights from the fields of political, economic, social and urban history, as well as explorations of a more literary nature. Students will consider, for instance, the historical circumstances that led to successive waves of immigration to the US, the economic role played by immigrants on American soil, the construction of and debates about race as a category of social analysis, and the impact of urban renewal projects on relations between racial and ethnic groups. In this context students might, as in the syllabus provided, read “Black Boy,” Richard Wright’s autobiographical depiction of his move from the south to Chicago as a young man, and “Raisin in the Sun,” Lorraine Hansberry’s dramatic portrayal of an African-American family living on Chicago’s South Side in the 1950s. The impact of racial and ethnic identity on urban centers in the US-in this instance through a comparative analysis of developments in New York and Chicago-represents yet another dimension of this theme.</p>
<p><strong>US-3:</strong> In this iteration the course is entirely devoted to the history of immigration to the US and its impact on American society, in particular how immigration has exerted an influence on urban environments. In other variations of the course immigration will continue to be a key theme, though it could be covered as it relates to other central issues of social and cultural history in the US, such as gender or race. Given the centrality of immigration to the social and cultural history of the US, it is literally impossible for this course to fail to focus heavily on it, though other iterations may ALSO add content on slavery or indigenous populations, through discusions of race as a historical category.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> HNRS 126W is taught by faculty from Urban Studies, Political Science, Sociology, History or Media Studies.  It covers demographical, spatial, economic, political, and cultural dimensions of immigration, assimilation, and Americanization as they have impacted New York City. Introducing a variety of theories and methodologies, including, for example, ethnography, oral history, media criticism, survey research or analysis of statistical data drawn from the US Census Bureau, the course is geared to enhancing students’ understanding of the role of immigration and migration in shaping New York City’s identity—past, present, and future.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Class readings consider the history of immigration and ethnic diversity in New York City as it has been shaped by successive waves of newcomers to the city. Discussions and graded assignments focus on debates over urban labor markets, neighborhood and community formations, migrant economies, and political incorporation and coalition building.  In order to engage in these debates students must learn to evaluate competing arguments and evidence.  Students develop critical thinking skills by reading scholarly works that exemplify techniques of critical analysis; for example, how does the metaphor of the “melting pot” relate to public opinion about immigrants, as well as the political culture of struggles over immigration in New York City? Class lectures and discussions also model critical and analytical thinking by working through competing arguments, evaluating the logic and evidence on which these arguments are based, and identifying their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students are required to write essays in the form of take-home papers or in-class exams.  These assignments require that students draw on information from class and readings to address important issues in immigration, urban, and ethnic politics.  Students are also asked to develop “neighborhood projects” employing methods such as, ethnographic fieldwork, demographic data analysis, media or archival research. These projects require students to develop written arguments about the impact that interest groups or legislative or adjudicatory bodies have had on the selected neighborhoods. These assignments all require that students are able to formulate coherent arguments and draw reasoned conclusions concerning diverse stakeholder positions.</p>
<p><strong>US-1:</strong> This course is interdisciplinary; students are introduced to theoretical perspectives from a range of scholarly disciplines including, for example, political science, sociology, urban studies, anthropology, history, and ethnic studies. Students are asked to synthesize concepts from different disciplinary approaches, and to use selected methods, both quantitative and qualitative, to formulate arguments within debates over the immigration, assimilation, and ‘Americanization’ concerning diverse groups in New York City.</p>
<p><strong>US-2:</strong> Taking the history of immigration in New York City as its major theme, the course examines debates over such issues as: (i) immigrant labor markets and economies; (ii) racial and ethnic relations; (iii) neighborhood formations and ethnic incorporation; and (iv) ethnic communities and subcultures. The scholarly perspectives that students draw on include historical analyses, sociological and demographic studies, and urban politics and policies.</p>
<p><strong>US-3:</strong> The course asks students to investigate the role of immigration and migration in shaping New York City’s identity—past, present, and future.  Topics may include factors that have driven and drawn people to New York since the 17th century; ethnic and racial encounters within the city; the formation and social organization of immigrant communities in such neighborhoods as, Five Points, the Lower East Side, Harlem, Little Italy, Chinatown, Jackson Heights, Astoria, and Flushing; the impact of successive waves of newcomers on US urban culture and politics; and the continuing debate over assimilation and Americanization.</p>
<p><strong>US-4:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>US-5:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>US-6:</strong> Issues of difference are at the forefront of this course. Focusing on the role of immigration and migration in shaping communities and ethnic subcultures in New York City, lectures and course readings are designed to examine the following patterns of life in contemporary U.S. society: (i) the ways religion, race, ethnicity, and gender influence immigrant experiences; (ii) the formation and social organization of various communities; and (iii) the impact of newcomers on urban culture and politics in New York City.</p>

<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Previously approved for the Perspectives CV Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students will use a variety of articles and sections of a book on languages spoken in the US. These sources address the languages from the perspective of linguistic differences, social evaluation, and educational impacts.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Most of the articles read involve the presentation of arguments, not simply facts about the languages concerned. Tasks involve evaluations of those arguments in small group presentations to the class. Students also relate the topics of the articles to their own linguistic histories and produce a final paper that examines in depth one of the topics studied.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> The group presentations are oral. The family linguistic histories and final project are written. They involve synthesis of topics in question.</p>
<p><strong>US-1:</strong> The concepts of linguistics are used to explore the linguistic diversity of the United States. The linguistic concepts are associated with the subfields of historical linguistics, educational linguistics, and sociolinguistics. 

Concepts from these fields are directly related to Queens College students’ own experiences of linguistic diversity.</p>
<p><strong>US-2:</strong> Language provides an excellent lens through which to examine a number of major themes in US history.

These include marginalization and resistance to it involving Native, African American, Asian and Latino communities. In addition, the role of American Sign Language as an example of how language can define a culture, in this case Deaf culture, is discussed. 

Similarly, issues of assimilation versus integration of minorities are discussed through the process of language shift—-an intergenerational process whereby a community gives up its historical language to become exclusively English speaking. The role of religion in language maintenance (i.e., the preservation of Pennsylvania German and/or Yiddish) may also be discussed.</p>
<p><strong>US-3:</strong> The origins of African American English are traced to the slave trade.
The presence of Spanish, European, and Asian languages are shown to respond to immigration as well as, in the case of Spanish, the conquest of the Southwest in the 19th Century. In addition, Spanish, Yiddish, and Asian languages are shown to have influenced varieties of English.
The continued presence of Native languages may be discussed and the response of Native peoples to pressures for language shift to English is also part of the curriculum.</p>
<p><strong>US-4:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>US-5:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>US-6:</strong> It is shown how linguistic diversity follows from social diversity and is used as what is called in the field an index (or marker) of identity and stances to identity. Forms of diversity identified by linguistics could potentially include race/ethnicity,socioeconomic status, gender and sexual orientation, religious traditions, age, and geography. All may be included in this course.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> The required readings for the course provide students with information from a variety of sources and points of view, ranging from the writings of the founding fathers, to decisions of the Supreme Court, to critical essays by influential thinkers, to surveys of current political science research.  Class lectures highlight the competing liberal and conservative perspectives on the nature of power and democracy in the U.S., particularly with regard to government intervention in the economy.  Writing assignments require students to gather, interpret, and assess the information.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> This course exposes students to fundamental debates over power and democracy that are at the heart of U.S. politics and government.  In order to engage in these debates students must learn to evaluate competing arguments and evidence.  Students develop critical thinking skills by reading scholarly works that exemplify techniques of critical analysis; for example, how does Tocqueville’s classic work on political culture relate to recent work on the subject?  Class lectures and discussions also model critical and analytical thinking by working through competing arguments, evaluating the logic and evidence on which they are based, and identifying their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students are required to write essays in the form of in-class exams and/or take-home papers.  These assignments require that students draw on information from class to address important issues in US politics.  For example, students might be asked what the framers of the Constitution would think about an aspect of politics today, such as the role of interest groups or the power of the Supreme Court.  Such assignments require that students understand different types of information and be able to formulate coherent arguments about how they are related.</p>
<p><strong>US-1:</strong> At the heart of this course are key concepts that concern political scientists, including power, democracy, and socioeconomic class.  In readings and class lectures students are introduced to the various methods, both quantitative and qualitative, by which political scientists investigate these issues.  For example, in studying the presidency, students may be asked to examine graphs and data regarding presidential approval ratings over time and, at the same time, to read a historical account of the struggles faced by particular presidents.</p>
<p><strong>US-2:</strong> This course begins with the fundamental themes of liberty, equality, and democracy that define the US political experience.  It then traces the historical evolution of these themes through attention to certain key eras and events: for example, the debate over the ratification of the Constitution; the Civil War and the 14th Amendment; the Great Depression and the New Deal; the Civil Rights movement; Roe v. Wade; President Reagan and New Federalism; Citizens United; etc.  On these issues and more, students are exposed to arguments from across the ideological spectrum.</p>
<p><strong>US-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>US-4:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>US-5:</strong> Roughly one-third of the course is devoted specifically to understanding the roles and powers of the three branches of the federal government.  This includes attention to how and why the Framers of the Constitution designed the branches as they did, and how these institutions of democracy have evolved over time.  Students will analyze the ways that Congress and its members do, and do not, represent their constituents; the extent to which the president has become the dominant force in national politics and policy-making; and the power of an unelected Supreme Court to override the democratically-elected branches of government.</p>
<p><strong>US-6:</strong> Issues of difference are at the forefront of this course, because a concern with power involves questions of who has power over whom (and how).  The course also recognizes that influence works both ways; that is, class, race, etc. shape our institutions and experiences, while institutions and experiences give meaning to class, race, and other forms of difference.  So, for example, students may consider how institutions dominated by Whites have constructed discriminatory policies that undermined opportunities for Black people and, in turn, how lower socioeconomic status shapes Black identities and undermines Black political power.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> One required book is a collection of essays and articles from the historical to the contemporary; this ensures that students are exposed to information from a variety of sources and points of view.  In addition, students read books and articles by influential political scientists, policy experts, legal scholars, and a former NY state legislator.  Class lectures highlight the competing perspectives of those who favor greater roles and powers for state and local governments and those who argue for more federal authority.  Writing assignments, including in-class essays and a research paper, require students to gather, interpret, and assess information from readings, lectures, and sources they uncover through their own research.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> This course exposes students to a fundamental debate over whether states and localities should have more power to make their own policy choices, or whether the federal government is better suited to handle the nation’s challenges.  In order to engage in this debate students are presented with competing arguments and evidence, ranging from case studies to quantitative data.  Class lectures and discussions model critical and analytical thinking by working through these competing arguments, evaluating the logic and evidence on which they are based, and identifying their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students write two in-class essay exams which require that they draw on information from class in order to address important issues concerning state and local governments.  For example, students might be asked: would it be better for New York State if residents were allowed to vote on laws directly, as they are in states like California?  Which level of government – local, state or federal – is best suited to handle education?  Such assignments require that students understand the information and be able to utilize it to formulate coherent arguments.  Additionally, in producing research papers on issues of state politics students must develop a thesis and support it with appropriate evidence.</p>
<p><strong>US-1:</strong> At the heart of this course are key concepts that concern political scientists including power, democracy, and government.  In readings and class lectures students are introduced to the various methods, both quantitative and qualitative, by which political scientists investigate these issues as they relate to state/local government.  For example, students read excerpts from V. O. Key’s classic book Southern Politics, which serves as an excellent illustration of the benefits and trade-offs between single- and multiple-case studies.  Students apply their knowledge of concepts and methods in class discussions, written exams, and research papers.</p>
<p><strong>US-2:</strong> The framers of the US Constitution adopted an innovative system of federalism –dividing government power between a national government and states/localities – in order to limit the power of the national government and make government more responsive to the people.  This course traces the evolution of federalism from the early decades of the country through the present, focusing on its implications for democracy and government policy.  Students come to understand how the system of federalism has affected everything from the battle for civil rights, to economic and social policies, to the quality of public education, to the ability of cities to address problems of poverty.  On these issues and more, students are exposed to competing arguments about national power versus state/local power.</p>
<p><strong>US-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>US-4:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>US-5:</strong> Because of our overarching concern with governmental structure, the roles and powers of the three branches of government emerge frequently in course readings and lectures.  For example, students learn about the evolution of governorships from their status as weak, appointed positions early on to their powerful roles of today; the professionalization of state legislatures in the 1960s; the prominent role of state courts on issues such as same-sex marriage and education funding; the emergence of a new breed of entrepreneurial mayors; etc.  Our focus on New York State – with its notorious three-men-in-a-room system of power sharing among the governor and legislative leaders – highlights the implications for democracy.</p>
<p><strong>US-6:</strong> As our Schattschneider reading makes clear, debates over federalism are not simply abstract arguments; how government is structured and power allocated has fundamental implications for who wins and who loses in society.  This, in turn, has profound consequences for different groups defined by race, ethnicity, class, etc.  “States’ rights” has, historically, served as a foundation for the oppression of Black people in the South; today it is argued to allow tough sanctions on immigrants and prevent federal efforts to expand benefits for lower-income people.  The Supreme Court’s federalism rulings affect everything from the power of corporations and labor unions to the rights of racial/ethnic minorities, immigrants, gays and lesbians, and others.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> This course introduces students to the study of American culture by using a schematic that includes the mutual influence of social structure and culture and the complex interaction of both.  For example, students will investigate Griswold’s concept of “the cultural diamond,” that explains connections among four aspects of culture:  cultural objects (symbols, beliefs, values, and practices), cultural creators (organizations and systems that produce and distribute cultural objects), cultural receivers (the people who experience culture and cultural objects), and the social world, the context in which culture is created and experienced).  In studying the rise of the Tea Party, students will analyze how the context of a recession enabled the movement’s leaders to utilize symbols such as the Constitution and framer’s intent to appeal to disenchanted voters and give rise to a new political party.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Students will critique primary texts (such as television and film excerpts, print and online media, music, and art) to analyze how and why these arguments define contemporary American culture.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students will engage in active inquiry through assignments such as group presentations in which they present key themes and examples of a topic.  Students will also write a research essay based on their respective interests in American culture.  Throughout the course, students will be challenged to determine the suitability of specific sociological theories in analyzing elements of culture.
For example, students may give a group presentation that discusses the representations of the underclass in current American popular culture.  Students may also wish to explore the subject of class in American culture in a research paper that draws from sociological theories.</p>
<p><strong>US-1:</strong> The course units reflect key sociological concepts: nationalism and civil religion, race and ethnicity, gender and sexuality, culture and consumerism, social and economic class, and media culture.  Assigned readings and class discussion allow students to explore the methods used to study each concept.</p>
<p><strong>US-2:</strong> Through readings and studying primary texts (such as television and film excerpts, print and online media, music, and art), students discover how sociological theories allow them to explore how values and ideas associated with American culture are developed and change over time.  The course encourages students to reflect on their own “American Experience” to learn the mechanisms for social change in the context of a democracy.</p>
<p><strong>US-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>US-4:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>US-5:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>US-6:</strong> To facilitate learning within each unit, students will study both a current topic and a set of sociological readings that help students understand the issue in its social context.  Students will also discuss a primary text that illustrates key themes.  For example, in the social and economic class unit, students will be given a profile of the American economy (economic indicators and forecasts) to familiarize students with its state and common descriptors.  Students will also watch a documentary that reveals the hardships that the working poor face in the US.  To understand important debates about the issue of class in the U.S, students will be introduced to a sociological framework that guides them through exploring concepts such as the underclass and the impact of inequalities.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives SS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives SS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students examine race and ethnic relations in the U.S. from a variety of perspectives:
•	The dominant sociological perspective: 
•	The subculture, e.g. immigration and ethnicity perspective.
•	The biological anthropological perspective.
•	Sources include essays, research articles and books.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> The class evaluates evidence that biology determines race.  We review the AAPA Statement on Biological Aspects of Race and compare this statement to a film, “Race: The Power of Illusion.” Biological arguments are then challenged by a sociological perspective that posits unequal distribution of power and social honor are justified by the fictional biology of race and unequal power, which, in turn, propagate structural inequality.  
The class then applies evidence of institutional differences faced by African Americans and Jews and Italians who were perceived as inferior white races at the turn of the 20th Century, but who became white ethnic groups in the Post WWII period.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Three short paper assignments (each around 4-6 pages), are designed to have students analyze and synthesize the readings.   Additionally, students are required to demonstrate command of the reading by orally summarizing the key arguments described.</p>
<p><strong>US-1:</strong> This course engages the fundamental concepts about race and status from the disciplines of sociology, political science, anthropology and biological science. We emphasize the social, political, economic and ideological constructedness of race over time.</p>
<p><strong>US-2:</strong> Students examine both the persistence and moderation of race and racism since the Civil Rights Movement, with a special focus on the labor market, residential segregation and the housing market.</p>
<p><strong>US-3:</strong> Starting with the Civil War, this course provides a survey of American History and the way that the system of slavery and what followed produced the current system of stratification, segregation and inequality today.</p>
<p><strong>US-4:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>US-5:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>US-6:</strong> Race and Ethnicity—as argued throughout this course—is understood by examining a pattern of social and economic inequality largely shaped by common social institutions.  

In the second part of the course, we shift gears and talk more about ethnicity and explore various theories to explain assimilation and mobility for various ethnic and racial groups.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Course readings—supplemented by documentary footage—provide students with a breadth of perspectives that range from the writings of early social scientists and reformers to a book by a sociologist that helped create the War on Poverty (1964) to an ethnography depicting the life of a poor family living in the South Bronx (2003). Writing and oral presentations require students to evaluate and present different theoretical explanations drawn from the readings.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> This course exposes students to fundamental debates over what constitutes good social policy.  In order to define the arguments, students must read the assigned scholarly works and evaluate the merits of each. For example, Jacob Riis argues that local government should not dispense charity in equal amounts to those who apply. Students must evaluate his argument and compare it to Charles Murray’s perspective about the problems with government policies that govern public welfare.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> All assignments require students to draw on information from the readings, documentary footage and class discussions to produce arguments that contain a clear statement of purpose with supporting evidence.  For example, students read an article describing the findings of a study—conducted in 2008—that measures outcomes of arts education programs.  They are asked to compare the findings with Jane Addams’ theory on the benefits of arts education for early immigrant children in 1965.</p>
<p><strong>US-1:</strong> This course traces the history of social welfare policy from the mid-1800s—to 1996 (the enactment of the federal welfare reform initiative, The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (PRWOA). Using material from a variety of social science perspectives, this course applies the philosophical underpinnings, and the economic, political and historic tributaries that formed the United States’ social welfare system.  Students gain an understanding of social welfare policy over time by reading books written by political activists (Jane Addams), journalists (Jacob Riis, Jason DeParle and David Simon), policy analysts (Michael Harrington), and sociologists (Charles Murray.)  The class also reads an ethnography written by an anthropologist /journalist of a multi-generational family living in the South Bronx in the 1990’s (LeBlanc).</p>
<p><strong>US-2:</strong> The Emergence of Federalism.  
•	Students investigate the evolution of federalism by first analyzing the 19th Century responses of local governments to environmental conditions, e.g., substandard housing, weak public health infrastructure, the lack of recreation.  
•	Next, students analyze the political and economic reasons that states created social welfare responses in the early part of the 20th Century. These efforts were largely modeled after New York State programs—started by governors Al Smith and Franklin Roosevelt.  
•	Students then examine the economic and political reasons for a larger, federal response to social welfare by analyzing the factors causing The Great Depression and the enactment of The New Deal.  
•	The class also examines federalism by investigating the case of school desegregation.  Reading articles, hearing lectures, and viewing documentary footage students gain an understanding of the role of the federal government in challenging states rights over the control of public schools.</p>
<p><strong>US-3:</strong> Social welfare policy is largely chronicled in the 19th Century and early 20th Century through the immigrant experience and each immigrant group’s path to political power.  Jane Addams (1845) describes the impact immigrants had on Chicago. Students will evaluate how The “Chicago School”—a group of largely European physicians, social scientists, and journalists under Addams’ tutelage—used the immigrant experience to shape an indigenous American Sociology. The class reads The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets and the introduction to The Fusion of Psychiatry and the Social Sciences that discusses the eclectic influence of the Chicago School in shaping America’s social welfare policy.   Students then investigate Jacob Riis’ parallel account of New York City’s immigrant experience and its profound affect on forming American social welfare policy.  The class reads How the Other Half Lives (Jacob Riis). Documentary footage narrated by leading historians and journalists supplements the readings and discussion of the immigrant experience and its influence in building social welfare institutions.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> This course exposes students to fundamental debates about fairness, equality, equity, power, and democracy that are at the heart of government and politics in the urbanizing United States.  It takes the US city as a repository of social, economic and political differences, and explores the pursuit of freedom, political inclusion and economic equality as it plays out in urbanizing contexts.  The required reading materials and class lectures provide students with information from a variety of sources and points of view.  For example, they read articles that explain why people are poor, why they vote or do not vote, why they live in segregated neighborhoods, why they support some governmental policies and oppose others, and why some people are upwardly mobile while others are not, from different political and theoretical perspectives.  Class lectures and reading materials highlight the historical and prevailing political and policy perspectives on the roots of social divisions, differences, and inequalities at both national and urban scales.  Students also compare evidence and arguments from a variety of sources including newspaper articles, think tank reports, scholarly articles, book chapters, and blogs.  Writing assignments frequently ask students to write from multiple perspective, including those that are not their own.  For example, one assignment ask them to endorse or oppose the welfare reform act of 1996 from the perspectives of a Republican Senator, a NYC city council Democrat, and a welfare rights activist.  Another essay asks them to read several articles about immigration, migration, and so-called “model minorities,” and then to tell the life story of an undocumented worker from Fuzhou, China.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Critical engagement with political and policy arguments is a cornerstone of the course.  Weekly lectures highlight a key issue — political inequality, wealth inequality, segregation, unemployment, labor market segmentation, the unequal distribution of environmental hazards — and then help students to understand its history and the way it has been debated publicly and in scholarly circles.  Reading material, weekly homework assignments (which ask the students to write short essays), exams, and in-class participation exercises are all organized to highlight and reinforce the critical thinking that is evident in reading materials and that is modeled in class lectures.  For example, in participation exercises and homework assignments, students are asked to debate the trade off between safety and security in the governmental management and policing of public space, and to compare and contrast pre-1970s and post-1970s urban development models.  These and other assignments ask students to work through competing arguments, to evaluate the logics and evidence on which they are based, and to identify strengths and weaknesses in policy proposals and in scholarly work.  Through lectures and classroom exercises, the course also helps students to gain a rudimentary understanding of qualitative and quantitative research methods from the social sciences.  Students read articles based on survey research, ethnographic research, audit studies, and large, census analysis, to compare the kinds of findings that they produce and to critically assess the adequacies of various research methods.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Although several sections of this course are taught in large lecture format, students are required to write 5-8 short homework assignments in essay format over the course of the semester, and they participate in small group discussions once a week, during which they do in-class writing or participate in classroom debates.  Homework essays and in-class writing assignments are designed specifically to help them to hone their writing skills and their skills in making oral argument around the key issues of economic and political inequality in the United States. These assignments require the students to draw on information, arguments, and debates presented during lectures and in required reading materials.  For example, each semester they have classroom debates about who benefits and who suffers under different modes of urban government, from the machine politics of the late 19th century, to the managerialism of the early post-war period, to the corporate-influenced urban entrepreneurialism of the last thirty years.   For their final exam, they write an essay that asks them to draw on evidence presented in reading material and lectures to assess the combined effects of housing, welfare, health, economic, criminal justice, and environmental policies on US cities and their residents.</p>
<p><strong>US-1:</strong> At the heart of this course are key concepts, methods and evidence that concerns the multi-disciplinary field of urban studies. In the first weeks of the course, students are introduced to the field: they learn that it emerged in the 1960s to bring together scholars and practitioners from many disciplines in order to create innovative, real-world knowledge of the challenges and opportunities of city life.  In subsequent weeks, lectures highlight the ways that interdisciplinary approaches help scholars to gain a particular vantage point on the sources of political and economic inequality in the urbanizing United States.  For example, in a lecture on urban politics, quantitative sociological data about racial and economic differences in voting patterns are presented alongside findings from qualitative studies of grassroots political campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>US-2:</strong> This course takes the American city as a lens through which to explore the broader themes of freedom, equality, and democracy. It focuses in particular on the struggle against political, economic and social inequality from the colonial period to the present.  It traces the shifting pattern of urbanization in US society and the attendant forms of inclusion and exclusion that became associated with US urbanizing society as it changed from a mostly rural colonial society in which cities functioned primarily as trade centers, to an urbanized industrial society in which cities functioned as manufacturing centers, to a post-industrial fully urbanized society in which large metropolitan areas function as service ad global command centers.  It introduces students to the broad demographic shifts, political and governmental changes, and economic arrangements that accompanied these shifts.  The course also compares the role of urban policies in addressing social, political, and economic inequalities from the New Deal heyday of the 1940s to the current period of governmental reform and privatization.  It also focuses on changing forms of urban politics and government during the same period.</p>
<p><strong>US-3:</strong> This course devotes considerable attention to the role of slavery and its legacies, indian removal and its legacies, and several waves of immigration in shaping US urban life.  The course helps students to understand the role of slavery and of indian wars and removal, in the establishment of US colonial cities.  It also pays considerable attention to the role of different immigrant groups in the social, economic, and political lives of the industrial and post-industrial cities of the United States, and of the shifting pattern of immigrant residency and work, as new immigrants move from the urban core to suburban and ex-urban areas.  Students also learn about the rural-urban migration of formerly enslaved African Americans and their descendants during the industrial period, and of return migration to the rural south, during the post-industrial period.</p>
<p><strong>US-4:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>US-5:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>US-6:</strong> Race, class, gender, sexuality and national differences are central topics for this course.  The central question of the course — why cities are places of economic and political opportunity for some and of deprivation, discrimination, violence, and impoverishment for others — is broken down into a series of units on different topics, each of which isolates and addresses various aspects of social differentiation and attempts by subordinated and marginalized groups to contest social, political and economic inequalities.   Weekly units on wealth inequality, poverty, immigration, racial segregation, militarization, environmental justice, welfare, criminal justice and  urban politics spotlight race, class, gender, sexuality or national differences and inequalities.  Each unit also explores various proposals to reduce these inequalities, from different political, theoretical and policy perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-1:</strong> We see this course as a potential model for Pathways at Queens College.  The course combines a 1.5 hour jumbo lecture by a core faculty member, with 1.5 hour discussion sessions, led by TAs, for 25 students or less.  This enables us to accommodate a large number of students without sacrificing the quality of education that small sections enable.  In particular, this course format allows the course to incorporate far more student writing than is typically possible in a jumbo course.  As we mention above, students write short essays, in class and out, on a weekly basis.  And exams also incorporate essay questions.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> This course exposes students to fundamental debates about the nature and scope of diversity in the urbanizing United States. It takes the US city as a repository of social, economic and political differences, and explores the pursuit of freedom, rights and recognition as it plays out in urbanizing contexts. The required reading materials expose students to city life from the point of view of new immigrants, immigrants who arrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, from the point of view of African Americans, women, white ethnics, and sexual minorities, among other groups.  Students also learn about major differences within major racial, ethnic, class, and gender categories, such as differences between work and community experiences of African Americans and Afro Caribbean immigrants and others.  Students also compare evidence and arguments from a variety of sources including scholarly articles, book chapters, and, unique to this course, through experiential learning exercises.  These exercises enable students to participate in or observe community-based art, history, blog and diversity projects.   For example, students participate in the “Crossing the BLVD” performance art and photography project, which we bring to Queens College.  Or they help Latino organizations in Jackson Heights to organize diversity day.  These activities are followed by in-class and other assignments through which they critically assess the ideas about diversity, power, difference and inequality that underlie these community-based assertions of diversity.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Critical engagement with diversity and related concepts are a cornerstone of the course. Weekly lectures highlight a key issue — racial and ethnic differences, gender, sexuality, immigration, anti-urban sentiment and its consequences for US cities, civil rights, assimilation  — and then help students to understand the histories and interconnections of race, class, gender, sexual and national differences, and their impact on community life.  Reading material, assignments and midterm and final essays are organized to highlight and reinforce the critical thinking that is evident in reading materials and that is modeled in class lectures. For example, they read about major political figures, such as Thomas Jefferson, who reviled cities because of their heterogeneity, and about other figures, such as Robert Park and Jane Jacobs, who celebrate it.  They debate if cities are sites of freedom or danger, or both, and for whom.  They also explore the merits of different diversity, assimilation, and multiculturalism paradigms, and learn about debates over the biological or social basis for racial and ethnic differences.  Students also read articles based on different kinds of social science research from survey research, geography, ethnographic research, historical studies and census studies.  They compare findings from different kinds of scholarly work and learn to assess the adequacies of various research methods.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Homework, essays, and in-class writing assignments and in-class exercises are designed specifically to help students to hone their writing skills and their skills in making oral argument around the key issues of diversity.  Assignments typically require students to draw on information, arguments, and debates presented during lectures and in required reading materials. For example, students write essays explaining the roots of urban diversity, or they pick a side in the assimilation vs. cultural diversity debate and write about that.  For the final, they typically write an essay that asks them to draw on evidence presented in reading material and lectures to discuss the substance and limits of multiculturalism paradigms.</p>
<p><strong>US-1:</strong> At the heart of this course are key concepts, methods and evidence that concerns the multi-disciplinary field of urban studies. In the first weeks of the course, students are introduced to the field: they learn that it emerged in the 1960s to bring together scholars and practitioners from many disciplines in order to create innovative, real-world knowledge of the challenges and opportunities of city life. In subsequent weeks, lectures highlight the ways that interdisciplinary approaches help scholars to gain a particular vantage point on the sources and meaning of diversity and inequality in the urbanizing United States. For example, in a lecture on sexism and the city, they compare the work of a geography, historian and cultural critic, each of which brings a unique disciplinary perspective to questions about the gendering of urban space.</p>
<p><strong>US-2:</strong> This course takes the American city as a lens through which to explore the broader themes of diversity, freedom, democracy,  and inclusion. It focuses in particular on the struggle for rights and recognition by subordinated groups, emphasizing scholarly debates over the merits and historical inevitability of assimilation on the one hand and the preservation of cultural diversity on the other. Different sections of the course introduces students to the history of African American freedom struggles, immigrant struggles for rights, recognition and political power, and women’s and sexual minority struggles for economic autonomy, community belonging, and political power and representation.  The course ends with a discussion of scholarly debates over multiculturalism.</p>
<p><strong>US-3:</strong> At minimum, one quarter of the course focuses on immigrant experiences in US cities, focusing in particular on late 19th and early 20th century histories of immigrant settlement in New York City, and on the post-1965 arrival of “new immigrants.” It also addresses the role that different immigrant groups have played in the fight for rights and recognition in American society.    
The section of the course on the immigrant city also pays considerable attention to the role of different immigrant and subcultural groups in the social, economic, and political lives of the industrial and post-industrial cities of the United States, and of the shifting pattern of immigrant residency and work, as new immigrants move from the urban core to suburban and ex-urban areas. Students also learn about the rural-urban migration of formerly enslaved African Americans and their descendants during the industrial period, and of return migration to the rural south, during the post-industrial period.</p>

<p><strong>US-6:</strong> Race, class, gender, sexuality and national differences are central topics for this course. The central question of the course — what makes cities diverse and how to cities manage that diversity — is broken down into four units that address key aspects of social differentiation in the United States and attempts by subordinated and marginalized groups to contest social, political and economic inequalities. The four areas are: 1) diversity and America’s urban dilemma; 2) the immigrant city; 3) urban subcultures; and 4) sexism and the city.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> This course examines the evolving political structure of American cities, especially New York, from the local, state, and national perspective and from a variety of scholarly and political viewpoints.  The required reading materials and class lectures provide students with information from a variety of sources and points of view.  In particular, the course highlights debates about the merits and limits of machine politics, entrepreneurial government, and reform movements and their impact on urban and national government.  It also highlights the role of urban politics in shaping public and social policies and the impact of national politics and policy on cities and their inhabitants.  It assesses urban and national government from the point of view of various political constituencies, including elites, ethnic groups, unions, and civil rights groups.  Students also compare evidence and arguments from a variety of sources including newspaper articles, policy briefs, think tank reports, scholarly articles, book chapters, and blogs.  For example, to gain a sense of current events, ongoing public debates, and political developments, students read the National and Metro sections of the New York Times.  Evidence from this and other sources is integrate into class discussion and writing assignments.  Writing assignments frequently ask students to write from multiple perspective, including those that are not their own.  For example, they are asked to defend or critique the New Deal’s urban renewal policies, which were controversial, especially from the perspective of African American and white ethnic communities that were displaced by them.  There is also an experiential learning component to this course that enables students to gather evidence on urban politics from real-life political events.  Typically students attend a community meeting or some other political event,  and are asked to analyze the power dynamics, forms of political authority, constituencies represented and not represented, and decisions that are made there.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Critical engagement with the meaning and organization of politics and governance are a cornerstone of the course. Weekly lectures highlight a key issue — machine politics,  ethnic politics, the structure of national, state and city government and how they relate, urbanization, urban policy making — and then help students to understand the different approaches scholars have taken to explaining these issues.  Reading material, assignments and midterm and final essays are organized to highlight and reinforce the critical thinking that is evident in reading materials and that is modeled in class lectures. For example, they read about various theories that explain urban governance, from the regulation school to urban regime theory, and learn to analyze the impact of various political forces — urban elites, the media, client-patron networks, organized labor, civil rights groups, ethnic associations, and policy experts, to name a few, on elections, urban policies and public resources distribution. They compare findings from different kinds of scholarly work and learn to assess the adequacies of various research methods.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Homework, writing assignments, and in-class exercises are designed to help students to hone their writing skills and their skills in making oral arguments about the nature of urban and national politics.  Assignments typically require students to draw on information, arguments, and debates presented during lectures, from NYC government sources, and in required reading materials. For example, students draw on historical evidence presented in their text book to explain how urban politics shaped New Deal social policies. They write a Community Field Research Essay that asks them to investigate the way that community boards, city council or participatory budget processes work in the neighborhoods where they live, or a Representatives Research Essay, which asks them to investigate who represents them at different levels of government (national, state, local).</p>
<p><strong>US-1:</strong> At the heart of this course are key concepts, methods and evidence that concerns the multi-disciplinary field of urban studies. In the first weeks of the course, students are introduced to the field: they learn that it emerged in the 1960s to bring together scholars and practitioners from many disciplines in order to create innovative, real-world knowledge of the challenges and opportunities of city life. In subsequent weeks, lectures highlight the interdisciplinary approaches that scholars use to study urban politics. For example, in units on budgeting, redevelopment, and environmental policy, case study approaches from sociology and political science are discussed.</p>
<p><strong>US-2:</strong> This course takes the American city as a lens through which to explore the broader themes of freedom, equality, and democracy. It focuses in particular on the structure and organization of US politics and government, and the struggle for inclusion, rights and recognition involving various groups, in historical perspective.  The course focuses in particular on the political culture of New York City, from the 19th century period of machine politics, through the mid-20th century New Deal period, to the present global era.  By focusing on these three periods, the shifting rules and modes of political participation at the local level, the struggle for political inclusion during each period, and the role of national government in shaping the city and its politics, the course helps students to understand how democracy in the United States actually works.</p>
<p><strong>US-3:</strong> No course on urban politics would be complete without a detailed analysis of ethnic politics.  Accordingly, this course focuses on immigrant political participation in US cities, focusing in particular on examples from New York City during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, during the second major wave of immigrant settlement in the city.  It compares ethnic politics from this period to that of the mid-20th century at the height of the New Deal, and today, in the post-1965 global era marked by the arrival of “new immigrants.” It also discusses the political power of African Americans in comparison that of other major racial and ethnic groups.</p>
<p><strong>US-4:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>US-5:</strong> One early unit of this course is devoted specifically to understanding the roles and powers of the three branches of the federal government, and then subsequent units show how national-level legislative, judicial and executive branch impact political decision making and democratic practice at state and local levels.  This includes attention to how and why the Framers of the Constitution designed the branches as they did, and how these institutions of democracy have evolved over time. Students will analyze the ways that Congress and its members do, and do not, represent their constituents; the power of the presidency to shape national and local politics and policy-making; and the impact of Supreme Court decisions, such as Brown Vs. Board of Ed., in urban and social policy domains.</p>
<p><strong>US-6:</strong> The extent to which race, class, gender, sexuality and national differences shape urban politics is the central topic of this course. Units on different topics isolate and addresses various aspects of social differentiation and its impact on political participation, governance, and issues of political representation and under-representation.  For example, units on machine politics discuss the role of white ethnics in the political machine and the under-representation of African Americans at national, state and local levels.  Unit also explore policy proposals to reduce political inequalities, from different political, theoretical and policy perspectives.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Questions are asked and answered through the lens of gender and apply a perspective that is both intersectional and multicultural. Knowledge is approached critically, for example, students are asked to consider who might benefit from the conventional wisdom on gender or how an unequal balance of power in the society has affected our understanding of production and reproduction, the division of labor, and the conduct of politics, war, education and more.

    The course takes a hands-on approach to acquiring knowledge with students forming research teams to investigate issues in women’s history and women’s struggles for freedom from social inequities such as disfranchisement and coverture. Students take to the front of the classroom to present their findings and debate and defend their research with classmates while the professor sits with the actively participating student audience. Students really engage with knowledge in this process—far more so than through lecture and reading alone.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> -	     The Women’s Studies Program offers interdisciplinary courses in the social sciences. The Program includes four courses that meet the core requirements for the Women’s Studies Major and Minor and many cross referenced courses in the sciences, Anthropology, English, Economics, Sociology, History, and Political Science.

      Women’s Studies majors engage in supervised community based internships in advocacy or service organizations for women such as battered women’s shelters, women’s health groups, and a feminist radio station. Students are able to relate feminist history and theory to social change and their formal paper for the internship often shows that they have learned more deeply how sexism affects women’s lives. 
      The Women’s Studies internships reflect the activist roots and goals of the discipline in the larger society. The field emerged during the second wave of U.S. feminism in the late 1960s as women participating in the movement developed a passionate desire to know the history of their sex and the causes of sexism so as to better take on the injustices they sought to eradicate. From a few experimental courses in 1969, Women’s Studies has since developed as an academic discipline in hundreds of colleges and universities some of which offer masters and doctorates in the field. Queens College offers an M.A. degree in Women’s Studies.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Diverse points of view from women in the colonial, 19th, and 20th century U.S. including Puritans, Native Americans, and African Americans are represented in the primary and secondary sources that are required reading in this course.
As texts two foundational accounts of women’s impact on class, race and feminist struggles are used, one by African American scholar Paula Giddings, the other by white historian Eleanor Flexner.
    Additionally, the class reads aloud from Promise and Betrayal, a dramatic reading comprised of lengthy excerpts from primary sources. Influential figures such as Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, William Lloyd Garrison, Ida Wells-Barnett, and others put forth opposing positions and arguments on causes and milestones in women’s history such as struggles for literacy and equal education, against coverture, for the abolition of slavery, and the 14th, 15th and 19th amendments. 
    Further readings include primary and secondary material offering opposing positions on birth control, women’s wages and working conditions, the civil rights struggle of the 1950s/60s and the first and second wave of feminism in the U.S.  A class presentation and the final research paper also help students learn to identify and gather information from authentic and credible sources. A class presentation and the final research paper also help students to learn how to identify and gather information from authentic and credible sources.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Eight required reading response papers accounting for 20% of the overall course grade are designed to develop students’ skills in interpreting and critically evaluating the readings. Students complete the response papers by answering questions in the syllabus that build the need to evaluate evidence analytically into the written response. The questions call upon students to: 
             * compare and contrast the experiences of women in various cultures and epochs,
             * “evaluate the arguments on both sides” of a debate and then take a position, 
             * fight their way through seemingly contradictory characteristics of laws and influential figures, 
             * ask the “que bono” question of various historical outcomes, 
             * explore possible differences between the conventional wisdom on a topic and alternative views that are suggested by historical evidence.
    The first required essay bases 40% of the grade on “quality of causal analysis” which is defined in the instructions for completing the assignment as “clearly stated causes, good support, convincing argument based on evidence.” Students are provided with a choice of two essays based on the following questions: “Was there more to starting the Civil Rights Movement than Parks’ individual act of defiance? Based on evidence from Rosa Parks: My Story, argue the relative importance of Parks’ refusal to give up her seat on the bus compared with other decisions she and others took. Take a position on what was most important in starting the movement” OR “The popular image of Rosa Parks as a meek, passive, turn-the-other-cheek sort of person is quite different than the impression that emerges from her memoir…..Using evidence from the memoir, support or oppose the argument that Rosa Parks agreed with the necessity of armed self-defense as a political tool in the fight for black civil rights.” This assignment requires students to critically evaluate, support, and argue a debatable thesis.
    Further, the course introduces students to important historical debates such as arguments between Carrie Chapman Catt who led state by state campaigns for women’s suffrage and Alice Paul who zeroed in on a federal amendment. They also discuss debates among abolitionists led by Frederick Douglass for extending the suffrage to former male slaves versus feminist abolitionist Sojourner Truth’s argument for giving the vote to women as well.
    Even on the midterm essay questions call upon students to compare and contrast “the ways in which the experiences of African-American and white women differed in winning and using the vote.” Or with another midterm essay students are asked to explain the ways in which important advocates applied “que bono” methods of investigation as they spearheaded particular causes. For example a question on the movement for birth control asks who Margaret Sanger and her contemporaries believed “benefited from ‘enforced’ motherhood. Do you agree? Support or dispute their arguments.”</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students collaborate in ongoing research teams to develop a presentation of their team’s findings to the class. The presentation includes a defense of their material in a question and answer session at the end. The team submits a list of the sources on which their presentation was based.
    The presentation must follow written guidelines that include a discussion of why the topic is important, whether the findings validate, challenge, or in some way differ from the conventional wisdom on the subject, and what the students found surprising in their research and why. The presentation must be based on at least two primary sources and one secondary source. The presentation accounts for 15% of students’ course grade.
   The course also requires each student to submit a final research paper which develops more deeply an aspect of the topic their research group chose for its presentation. As specified in the syllabus “the paper should present…. Your thesis about the particular issue… you have investigated. Support the position you take with arguments based on historical evidence and show your sources in reference notes.”
     In preparation for completing the paper students participate in specific exercises in class that help them learn to differentiate a thesis from a descriptive statement. They participate in coming up with a thesis developed from their research for their presentation. Each student shares a draft thesis with classmates in a class discussion with everyone in the class participating in critiquing and helping their classmates develop a thesis. We go around the room several times with each student presenting a draft thesis to the whole class followed by a discussion of the draft.
	A final exercise on the paper includes the exchange of peer review forms by pairs of students. Students read each other’s papers and among other aspects of the review they must identify their classmate’s thesis and evaluate it on the form. The form is returned to the student whose paper it reviewed. Students then take another week to work on their papers.</p>
<p><strong>US-1:</strong> This course explores core concepts of the interdisciplinary field of Women’s Studies. Most importantly, it introduces students to the ways in which the study of women and gender transforms our understanding of culture and history, particularly when it comes to female agency. Have women simply been victims of sexism or have they taken a vital role in making historical change for their sex and also on issues affecting the nation as a whole? Required readings introduce students to the leading activism of women in the abolitionist movement including the military campaigns of Harriet Tubman, the political impact of Tubman and Sojourner Truth on presidential policy during the civil war. Students also study the female leaders in the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s including the not widely recognized political sophistication and militancy of Rosa Parks which is explored first hand in a major written assignment based on Parks’ memoir.
   Additionally, reading assignments and reading response papers engage students in exploring and exposing the “persisting myth that women of color were not interested in feminism.” African American women’s leadership level participation in first and second wave feminism is explored in required reading of important but not widely known women such as Alice Dunbar Nelson, Pauli Murray, and Frances Beal. Students are also introduced more fully to the agency of African American women in the course text When and Where I Enter.
    Another core concept of the discipline is the social construction of gender. The course illustrates this concept by exploring, among other things, the ways in which gender bias has limited our knowledge of history. For example, Harriet Tubman led military campaigns in the Civil War but the conventional wisdom has reduced the scope of her work to activities more in keeping with women’s socially acceptable role such as helping the less fortunate by assisting in the escape of slaves via the Underground Railroad. Students are introduced to primary source evidence of her broader role and they evaluate their newly gained evidence in a reading response paper. 
      The course also introduces students to the core Women’s Studies concept of the gender division of labor in production and reproduction and its ramifications in economic and social policy including legislation such as the Family and Medical Leave Act (parental leave) and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. This perspective is an ongoing theme of lecture and class discussion and is highlighted in the reading and reading response papers for the class covering Women in the Labor Movement and later in Women’s Economic Independence. International comparisons of gendered wage gaps and parental leave policies in other nations which require fathers to use parental leave take students by surprise and help them reconsider the immutability of women’s assigned roles in production and child rearing.</p>
<p><strong>US-2:</strong> By comparing the accounts provided in the texts by Paula Giddings and Eleanor Flexner students explore the different perspectives of African American and Euro American activists as they worked together and separately to bring about historical change, including in the anti-slavery movement, the labor movement, the struggle for the vote, and the second wave of feminism. Without specifically contrasting Flexner’s text with the information and views provided by Giddings, the African American scholar, Flexner’s account would appear inclusive of the work of African American women and their views. By reading selections on the same topic from both books for the same class session students are introduced to the differences in the way these struggles appeared to their participants and different perspectives taken by scholars.
     Readings for the class also compare the status of women among the Puritans and the Wampanoags, a Native American nation in the Northeastern U.S. Students complete a reading response paper and conduct a formal debate in class over whether women’s status was more nearly equal with men’s under the Puritan prescriptions of European culture compared with the ways of east coast hunter gatherer societies which operated along matrilineal kinship systems.  
	 The course also introduces students to the contrasting perspective of social history or history from the “bottom up” with the “Great Man” theory which explains history mostly on the basis of the impact of unusually distinctive heroes. Students are introduced to grass roots activism and the influence of social movements on social change and gain new appreciation for the ability of everyday people to affect the circumstances they find themselves in.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives SS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives SS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Fundamental to cultural anthropology is the differing and changing interpretations about human history, behavior, and society, both by anthropologists and those with whom anthropologists work. Students are expected to understand different interpretations of historical phenomena or practices and to determine why particular explanations or interpretations are deemed by anthropologists to be the most sound. At the same time, also fundamental to cultural anthropology is its aim to encourage students to question their own points of view. By reading a variety of texts, we question what assumptions students may have about their own practices and beliefs, and why they may have those assumptions.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> This course emphasizes the importance of the distinctive methods in anthropological work. In particular, students are expected to appreciate not only the importance of participant-observation, but also the practice of writing ethnographies. In so doing, the course examines how arguments about societies are constructed in ethnographic texts and how authors make choices about subject matter, evidence, and style. We ask: Does the evidence that the author provides substantiate the argument that he or she is making? Given the evidence provided, how else might we interpret particular events, phenomena, or relationships?</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students are required to articulate and illustrate in their assignments how authors make analytic arguments and what kinds of kinds of evidence they bring to bear to support those arguments. For example, in reading Lila Abu-Lughod’s famous ethnography Veiled Sentiments, students are regularly asked to explain and outline her theory of gendered modesty and its role in Bedouin society. Students are then asked to consider whether the evidence she provides substantiates this theory. How else may the evidence be interpreted?</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> Fundamental to Anthropology 101 is the ability to understand the varying analytic categories anthropologists have developed to think about and compare world cultures. For example, students must be able to recognize and identify the different ways that politics and economic systems can be organized, how social hierarchies can be practiced, and how religions may vary in their hierarchies of authority and their notions of supernatural forces.</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> The course examines all three of these themes (culture, globalization, and global cultural diversity) by introducing students to categories of analysis that help us understand cultural differences and similarities, by reading about particular practices and beliefs that may differ from those predominant in the US, and by considering the forces of globalization (colonialism and capitalism) that effect global cultures. The differing points of view examined in the course include those of anthropologists whose distinct theories about cultural practices and beliefs are explored as well as the varying points of view raised by the material in the ethnographies themselves.</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> An analysis of the “historical development” of non-U.S. societies is the subject of numerous sections of this course. Students are expected to understand historical development on two levels. First, they are introduced to the notion of historical development when they learn of the history of the discipline itself. They learn of anthropology’s 19th century investment in the idea that societies passed through particular stages of development and how early 20th century anthropologists opposed these ideas. In so doing, students learn how the discipline turned away from history, at least for much of its own history. Second, when historical development (or change) becomes critical to the anthropological endeavor, especially when anthropologists become more interested in the effects of colonialism and capitalism, students are expected to be able to identify these effects in the societies about which the ethnographic work they read examines.</p>
<p><strong>WG-4:</strong> Students in this course are expected to recognize the impact of colonialism, the emergence of post-colonial nationalism throughout the world, and the ways that anti-colonial movements helped establish modern nation-states, how “culture” and “traditions” were often used in these struggles, and how they have become fundamental to the maintenance of nation-state identities and claims of uniqueness and difference.</p>
<p><strong>WG-5:</strong> This course focuses not only on the differing ways that societies around the world practice and form all these methods of social differentiation, but students are also asked to recognize how these characteristics of human differentiation are often considered “natural,” even though they may be rather “arbitrary” and the product of social, economic, political, and environmental forces.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Among the distinctive contributions of Comparative Literature is its emphasis on what has been called the “worlding” of literature, the various ways in which literature helps us to see and understand the world we live in and its multiple pasts, presents, and futures, and on the importance of textual analysis and translation as communicating vessels between languages and cultures.  This course aims to provide students with a greater awareness of the global cultural contexts in which literary works are created (which is intended to enhance rather than diminish consideration of the aesthetic qualities of these texts).  The course draws its assigned readings from ancient times to the early modern period (a period spanning the 3rd millennium BCE to the early 16th century CE).  It may include both written and oral materials, with a focus on the plurality (and where possible the intersections and interactions) of ancient and pre-modern worlds: Greece and Rome, China and India, the global Middle Ages, the empires of North and West Africa, the Renaissance and the pre-Columbian world.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> By asking students to examine their own culture-bound preconceptions in the process of exploring primary documents created within cultures and civilizations remote in space and time, the course will aim to establish the continuing relevance of antiquity’s myriad insights and contributions to the larger (global) society we all inhabit.  While the specific historical and cultural contexts that gave rise to these literary works will be emphasized, it is equally important to explore issues of translation and introduce the students to techniques of close readings in order to establish a balance between temporal (and often cultural) distance and the intimate proximity conferred by the act of reading.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> The global scope and broad temporal sweep of the course materials involve works from a variety of often remote cultural and historical contexts, which have in turn inspired a great deal of commentaries and theoretical speculations, some of which will, as applicable, be represented in the course.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> As much of the literature of the ancient and pre-modern world involves philosophical and religious beliefs that may be at a certain distance from what many students believe, priority will be accorded to understanding these works within their specific contexts.  The importance of developing well-grounded (rather than merely visceral) arguments about the ancient world that avoid anachronistic criticisms will be stressed.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Written assignments will cover the comparative and cross-cultural (and trans-temporal) issues that emerge from the reading and class discussions.</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> In keeping with the most recent directions in Comparative Literature, this course is intended to examine, question, and hopefully transgress the conventional definitions of and boundaries between “West” and “East” in favor of a more pluralist, transcultural vision of how cultures and civilizations form and are formed through various modes of interaction and exchange.  The course aims to look at antiquity and the pre-modern era from a comparatist, global perspective, as contributors to and shapers of the multiplicity of perspectives in today’s world, but also on their own terms (to the extent this can be accomplished at such a temporal distance).</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> If anything, this course shows that “global cultural diversity” is not a modern invention and that there was more interaction than once thought among worlds previously considered as remote from each other.  “Globalization” of a sort occurred with the Renaissance, and this will be considered from a multifaceted perspective; for instance, the “discovery” and conquest of the Americas will be seen from both the perspective of the Europeans and the Native peoples.</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> This is self-evident vis-a-vis the course, as the US didn’t come into existence during the millennia covered in the material.</p>

<h3 id="WCGICMLIT206">CMLIT 206 Literature and Conflict [WG]</h3><h4>Approved 2012-12-03</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Individual experiences of various armed conflicts around the globe in the 20th century call attention not only to specific ordeals but to the historical contexts that give rise to them.  In short, the individual speaks for larger communities.  A community of the incommensurable is created.  Comparative Literature, as a discipline dedicated to establishing common ground across differences that are nonetheless acknowledged, offers a space where the causes and resolutions of conflicts can be articulated through analysis of literary works.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> The larger — global — society remains beset by wars and other armed conflicts, so the relevance of such a course, focused on armed conflicts past and present, should be evident.  Strategies of conflict resolution have been much discussed in recent years, and using literature as a potential path to such resolution illuminates the problems involved in a way that both complements and extends conventional approaches.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Armed conflicts, whatever their causes and the scale on which they are fought, have been a feature of much of human history, and literature has been an important register of and response to these conflicts, from ancient times to the present day.  A comparative exploration of literary works dealing with armed conflict necessarily involves a broad scope and variety of individual perspectives and cultural and historical contexts.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Since one of the major purposes of this course is to use literature as a means for discussion of techniques of conflict resolution, matters of individual ethics as well as historical causation will come into play.  Where literature issuing from present-day conflicts (e.g., Afghanistan, Israel/Palestine)is concerned, critical evaluation of evidence and arguments on both “sides” becomes imperative.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Understanding the roots and motives for armed conflicts involves going beyond ingrained preconceptions, and literary works are well-suited to fostering this.  Short response papers and a research paper, and class discussions, will be central to the course.</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> This course posits that comparative literature, with its intrinsically global scope and its methodological interplay between aesthetics and historical context, can be an important element in conflict resolution.  Given that war has been a constant global phenomenon in the modern era, a comparative approach enables a more nuanced and informed perspective on both the root causes of conflict and the individual experiences of such conflict.</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> There are cultures of war, and globalized wars (cf. WWI and WWII), and wars that spread beyond established frontiers and, at their conclusion, reshape them.  Discussing armed conflict as an attribute of globalization, while not commonly done, is valuable for showing the less sunny sides of “diversity,” and understanding its complex causes may contribute towards a more inclusive diversity.  As well, the individual experience of warfare, which literature often deals with, contributes to  a less abstract, more humanistic understanding necessary to envision ways and means of conflict resolution.</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>WG-4:</strong> As the world’s societies have in large part been shaped by armed conflicts, be these revolutions, civil wars, colonial wars, or wars of global reach, a course dedicated to the literatures emerging from these conflicts — past and present — necessarily involves analyzing matters of great significance to the contemporary world.</p>

<h3 id="WCGICMLIT208">CMLIT 208 Literature and Society in North Africa and the Middle East [WG]</h3><h4>Approved 2012-12-03</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Given the recent upheavals in North Africa and the Middle East, analysis and discussion of the literature, film, and societies of the region will be shaped by the ongoing transformations in politics and daily life that affect not only the people of the region but the globe as a whole.  Our discussions will engage with these current developments as they fit into our study of the material on the syllabus.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> There is a need for a comprehensive survey course that can lead to a greater understanding of the cultural and socio-political background to the continuing revolts in North Africa and the Middle East, and their possible future directions.  The region has become a focus of interest not just for specialists but also for the general educated public and the governments of the US and the European Union.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Given the geographical scope of the course, and the international focus of attention on the region in recent years, there should be ample space for exploring diverse points of view and cultural specificities.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Providing historical and literary context for a region currently at the forefront of global attention enables better critical/analytical approaches to be formulated.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Oral presentations, short essays, and a research project will be the vehicles for critical and analytical work in the class.</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> Offering a comprehensive focus on the culture and society of a region as complex as North Africa and the Middle East involves the use of (among others) tools of historical, political, anthropological, media-studies, and literary analysis, all of which will be brought to bear on readings and class discussions.</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> The cultural diversity of the region and its historical inheritances from forces outside the region — from the Ottoman Empire to Western colonialism and present-day globalization — as well as the recent uprisings, require a broad range of sources and viewpoints.</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> The historical development of the various societies forming part of the North Africa/Middle East region will be at the center of the course.</p>

<h3 id="WCGICMLIT210">CMLIT 210 The Early Modern Atlantic World [WG]</h3><h4>Approved 2012-12-03</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> By comparing an array of early modern texts from a variety of perspectives (Spanish, English, French, Nahuatl), students will gain a better understganding of how hitherto separated cultures converged in a key region of the emerging global world: the Atlantic.  Questions of conquest, exploration, colonization, and indigenous resistance to those phenomena will be explored and discussed.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Comparative Literature is based, inter alia, on cultural discourse analysis, formal literaruy analysis, and historical contextual analysis, and in endeavoring to understand the birth of the Atlantic world, all these analytical methods are important.  Understanding how the Americas were constructed for and by Europe — the first globalization — is vital to a broader knowledge of the modern world, and of globalizing patterns in the world today.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students will compare and contrast the encounter of European and indigenous inhabitants from both a variety of European and Amerindian points of view,</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> The first paper topic, for example, asks students to compare and contrast the view of the conquest of Mexico in Bernal Diaz’s chronicle and the narrative histories and poetic laments in “The Broken Spears.”  This assignment will set the tone for the remaining class sessions.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Oral presentations are part of the class requirements, as are papers based on the readings.</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> Texts will be analyzed in relation to such fundamental concepts of the discipline of Comparative Literature: a) cultural discourse analysis; b) literary formal or generic analysis (identification of literary forms and their rhetorical strategies); c) symptomatic reading or analysis of ideology.</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> Students will study the significance of such globalizing movements as European exploration, colonization, religious conversion, and criticism of these movements, as well as the destruction, resistance, preservation, and cultural change of indigenous inhabitants and their cultures.</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> </p>

<h3 id="WCGICMLIT225">CMLIT 225 Literature and Anthropology [WG]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-04-16</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Knowledge is acquired through reading and in-class discussion. Evidence in support of an argument is based on citations from primary and secondary texts. Questions are asked and answered in the form of a dialogue between student and instructor, and in small working groups of students who present their findings to the class.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> In today’s society, interactions between different cultures and societies, and across national and linguistic borders, have become everyday occurrences. The notion of an isolated national territory has given way to that of internationally linked communities. At the same time, unique cultures, customs, and traditions continue to exist, making for a complex, richly patterned universe. The ensuing diversity of literary and artistic expressions from different peoples around the globe is what Comparative Literature aims to teach. If globalization implies the movement and circulation of ideas, people, cultures, and commodities, Comparative Literature is the real and symbolic currency of that enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> The variety of sources for this course consists in anthropological, historical, and sociological narratives, both fictional and theoretical, all of which are centered on the specific anthropological topic (here: “Immigration in Europe”). The class discusses critical essays pertaining directly to the authors studied. And the instructor screens films and introduces relevant music (e.g. Turkish-German rap). Students are encouraged to read newspaper and magazine articles on the topic as it is currently relevant.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Students are asked to respond to their readings orally and in writing, both formally and informally. Discussion functions as a means to prepare debate on questions provided by the instructor, such as: “Is fundamentalism a reaction to forced assimilation; or a result of ghettoization?” Students respond with citation from primary texts, as well as paraphrase from theoretical texts. They are also encourage to bring in demographic data and legal information, as well as to perform field work (interviews of students on campus) where feasible.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> The evidence gathered by students in support of the points they want to make should be grounded in their readings of the literary and theoretical texts on the syllabus and selected bibliography. Discussion is guided and facilitated by the instructor via study questions posted in advance on Blackboard. Students are expected to present their thinking in response to these questions, and to question one another in the form of constructive criticism and debate.</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> The basic precepts of Comparative Literature is to de-center worldviews that are limited to one single language or culture. Comparing and contrasting languages, cultures, disciplines, and media create new perspective. From this perspective, one looks at the “other” as different, providing the occasion to learn something new; and as “related” in the sense that, no matter how different, all groups of people belong together as part of the human family. It is this interplay between respecting differences and recognizing mutual affinities that the method of Comparative Literature actively seeks to encourage.</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> Globalization is the gradual disintegration of national boundaries which enables immigration flows, but also increasing cultural homogeneity. Students are encouraged to discover similarities and differences between cultures by embracing a common humanity and, at the same time, respect otherness. In this particular sample course, Europe functions as a common denominator for groups of immigrants confronted with practices of inclusion and exclusion. These depend on each European nation’s history, e.g. colonialism in France, and communism in South East Asia and East Germany.</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> Germany has been divided in the context of the cold war and, as a result, two groups of immigrants are now present there: Vietnamese in former East Germany; and Turkish from the influx of “guest workers” during the “economic miracle” after WW II. Nevertheless, Nazi race laws were not changed until 2000 to permit German citizenship via naturalization (which differs from the US). And, although this has changed, attitudes against immigrants prevail in Germany and France, where citizenship was granted to former colonies, yet their inhabitants continue to be treated as second-class citizens.</p>
<p><strong>WG-4:</strong> For example, communism as a movement that has shaped Eastern Europe and large parts of Asia in the context of the cold war is analyzed and discussed in this class. The class reads Karl Marx, a European writer, to discuss his impact on the world’s societies that were or remain Communist. Divided Germany provides one example; and another Vietnam, in its war against the US (the film on the syllabus, The Quiet American, shows how the cold war is produced there in its early stages). We are also reading writers from Eastern Europe, i.e., Rumania, whose historical experience encompasses both fascism and communism. Students are asked to recognize the specific type of linguistic code used by such writers to escape censorship and/or cater to the requirements of a specific regime.</p>
<p><strong>WG-5:</strong> Many of the writers discussed are women and/or of color. Afro-German poet May Ayim committed suicide because she felt she had no community in Germany, where children of black GIs were ostracized and discriminated against. The syllabus contains essays such as Edward Said’s introduction to Orientalism which set up the basic guidelines for students to understand how people are “othered” and exoticized, by often well-meaning scholars in the West. It also contains Benedict Anderson’s introduction from “Imagined Communities,” which demonstrates that people’s thinking about their communities is largely fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>WG-6:</strong> Almost all the authors on the syllabus are not originally writing in English. Many have acquired the language in which they write as a second language, e.g. Japanese author Yoko Tawada publishes in German, Vietnamese author Linda Le in French, etc. Even if their native language is German, as in the case of Turkish-German Zafer Senocak, they may not see themselves as Germans because they are second or third generation and thus still perceived as “immigrants” in Europe. The class discusses the difficulty of rendering, for example, “broken German” into English, to ask what is lost and gained in translation of, specifically, bilingual writers from languages other than English.</p>

<h3 id="WCGICMLIT229W">CMLIT 229W Women in Modern World Literature [WG]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-04-16</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Comparative Literature is the study of literature not limited to any one national language or culture. Its method is comparison and contrast. Knowledge is acquired through reading primary texts in various genres (drama, narrative, poetry); and questions are asked and answered via in-class discussion, research and writing assignments. Theoretical essays and literary criticism constitute part of this study, aiming to provide new perspectives on other languages and cultures that are different from what students are familiar with.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> In today’s society, interactions between different cultures and societies, and across national and linguistic borders, have become everyday occurrences. The notion of an isolated national territory has given way to that of internationally linked communities. At the same time, unique cultures, customs, and traditions continue to exist, making for a complex, richly patterned universe. The ensuing diversity of literary and artistic expressions from different peoples around the globe is what Comparative Literature aims to teach. If globalization implies the movement and circulation of ideas, people, cultures, and commodities, Comparative Literature is the real and symbolic currency of that enterprise.
This course has been cross-listed with Women’s Studies. It is about images of women, as represented in the literature and art of different cultures; and about writing by women in different languages.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> This course is writing-intensive, requiring a research paper about at least two of the authors on the syllabus. Students are presented with a selected bibliography by the instructor as part of the syllabus; and then asked to read critical essays about the authors they want to write about, so as to develop their thesis. After revising their drafts, they are asked to orally present their work-in-process to the other students for feedback. The aim is to establish a dialogue about questions that are relevant within the context of the course, e.g. how women see themselves in relation to men, what happens when women participate in warfare, motherhood, etc.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Students are encouraged to perform close readings of selected prose passages to examine their poetic content, their mode of address, syntactical structures, tone, etc. so as to view these creative writings by women as expressions that include, by definition, a critique of conventional structures. Students ask to what extent women are complicit with or actively writing against ways in which they are perceived and/or expected to write. They discover that some women write “like men” and some men “like women,” which raises the question of what these categories mean to begin with. The aim is not to read creative writings by women sociologically, i.e., based on what they refer to; but to see them as performative, creating their own, unique reality. Hence evidence has to be evaluated on the basis of close readings of poetry and prose.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> As students grapple with questions such as what constitutes “femininity” in writing; gender inequities; same-sex desire; etc. they engage with what the authors have to say. The texts on the syllabus provide the grounds for discussion and subsequent engagement in a research paper, that must be supported by evidence from the text. The paper can address topics such as how in a given novel masculinity is portrayed, whether nature is represented as maternal, how women depict their role in the domestic sphere, etc. Depending on the two books from different cultures students are asked to compare, their arguments need to be supported with evidence from the texts.</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> Comparative Literature provides a unique forum for cross-cultural awareness, because it examines the contributions of all peoples to the human adventure. As part of this adventure, we believe that interpretation and translation – the arts of understanding one another by thinking across cultural and linguistic boundaries – are crucial to navigating the challenges of living in this now globalized world. By comparing and contrasting different languages and cultures, Comparative Literature invites students to expand their horizons and consider the perspectives of others; and to recognize, without glossing over tangible differences, the similarities between all members of the human race, which includes the 50% discussed in this course, i.e., women.</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> The course addresses different cultures seen through the eyes of women. As students grapple with questions about what constitutes “femininity” in writing; what constitutes gender oppression; about mother-daughter relationships, and other related topics, they engage with what women authors from cultures other than their own have to say. They encounter differences between what may be their own preconceived notions of women from cultures other than their own; or even within their own culture. Questions debated include whether women are, by definition, more peaceful; and whether they are more or less oppressed in other parts of the world.</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> The course covers women writers from Korea, the Middle East, Vietnam, Japan, Germany, and France, among other countries and regions. These are specific in that each author is discussed within the context of the culture from which she writes: for example, in a text by a Lebanese woman writer, the question of martyrdom arises in relation to warfare; and the Korean author draws attention to the stereotype of the “silent” Asian woman by leaving pages blank throughout her book. Students are asked to perform research about the authors they choose to write about, so as to contextualize them in their historical situation.</p>
<p><strong>WG-4:</strong> In discussions about feminism, questions include whether women’s writing differs from that of men; to what extent gender is constructed rather than biologically determined; how different cultures around the world address gender discrimination; and how women may empower themselves through writing. Students trace the history of feminism starting in the late 19th century; and are encouraged to explore differences between, for example, French and American feminisms. Special attention is paid to the newly emerging discipline of queer studies.</p>
<p><strong>WG-5:</strong> Obviously, gender and sexual orientation are the focus of this course, but in a comparative, world literary context. The course explores how societies construct images of “women”; and how they are seen through the eyes of the women themselves.</p>
<p><strong>WG-6:</strong> All books on the syllabus are translated from other languages; and translation is discussed as in issue in its own right - starting with the question of why some books are not published and/or difficult to obtain in some parts of the world. 
By teaching texts from different languages, we ask what is gained and what is lost in translation. This entails asking which texts have been translated and why; and how the translation of texts from one language to another has had an impact on other texts and cultures.</p>

<h3 id="WCGICMLIT230">CMLIT 230 African Literatures [WG]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-04-16</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Through a reading of a representative selection from the diverse (and millennial) literatures (including oral literature) of the African continent, and through class discussion, both to counter entrenched stereotypical representations of an undifferentiated “Africa” and to demonstrate the continent’s centrality to the development of the modern world, as well as its possible futures.  Pre-colonial, colonial, and contemporary African societies will be examined through a literary perspective.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> The study of Africa and African literature is fundamental to the acquisition of a truly global consciousness.  Comparative Literature, with its interdisciplinary focus, is well-suited to conveying a sense of the cultural and linguistic diversity, and the range of literary styles, of the continent.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Representative texts (drawn from all areas of the continent and spanning all historical epochs) will be read and analyzed in order to provide greater understanding of the complexities of pre-colonial Africa, the colonial project, and the movement towards independence and a postcolonial order.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Africa has been for the West a screen on which to project diverse fantasies, dreams of conquest, civilizing missions, etc., and studying African writing necessarily entails a critical look at what the West has made of it, both conceptually and historically, as well as what Africans themselves have done to create independent images of themselves and their pasts, presents, and futures.  Students will enhance/deepen their understanding of the importance of a continent on the cusp of reinventing itself.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Written assignments, including research, based on the readings and class discussions will be an important component of the course.</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> The image that “Africa” evokes in a reader is as paradoxically varied as the contradictions that plague and bless the continent. The paradoxes that dot the African landscape present a conundrum for the moralizing and totalizing analyses elaborated by experts and pundits intent on compartmentalizing experiential wisdom.  The African world view both shapes and is shaped by global crosscurrents that emanate from and contribute to the continuum of human civilization.</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> The Atlantic slave trade, its colonial sequels, and the protracted struggles for independence, have all involved world-changing processes with Africa as their focal point.  And Africa itself is a great crucible of cultures with global ramifications.</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> This course focuses on achieving a contextual understanding of how cultures outside the U.S. — specifically, the broad range and diversity of African cultures — assess and account for the production and maintenance of institutions and practices that shape and legitimate social values, with attention to how these cultures shape themselves in response to external pressures.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> The focus of this course is comparative and holistic in nature, focusing on modern African literature and literary theory in relation to literary works and theoretical essays written in other cultural contexts, with the aim of developing a critical vocabulary capable of situating literary works in their specific sociocultural settings as well as establishing their universal relevance.  Students will learn to dentify how narratives across cultures both cooperate with and contest institutions, symbols, forms, practices, and interpretations.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> African literature, when taught in the classroom, is rarely considered in dynamic relation to other literatures, and this course places key works of African literature in dialogue with texts from European and American cultures.  In a highly interconnected world, the divisions between national and regional literatures should be bridged to the greatest extent possible.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Texts from African, European, and American cultures will be read and studied comparatively and supplemented with theoretical readings from a similar range of cultural conrexts.  The emphasis will be on how historical, political, and social factors affect literary representations, and on exploring the ways in which diverse literary and cultural texts, while differing in content and form, might share a code of reference.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> A combination of lecture and maieutic questioning will be used during class sessions, and students will use theoretical writings to develop their own dialogues with the primary literary works.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Essays, journals, and class presentations, all of which will be grounded in the student’s individual engagement with the texts, will form a fundamental part of the class.</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> Offering a literature course in a world context entails delving into the particularities and commonalities of the texts under scrutiny, in this case, novels drawn largely from African literature that are placed in relation with certain key texts from European and American contexts. The entry point to this course involves limning the contours of the texts under analysis, and, through a comparative and contrastive undertaking, extracting from them a comprehensive critical vocabulary able to accommodate the textual, authorial, and cultural differences that emerge from the reading.</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> The course offerings, while centered on African literature, have a broad cultural sweep and will be used as means of decompartmentalizing disciplines and epistemologies.  At the same time, how narratives are produced and the culture-bound nature of craft will be discussed.</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> The course emphasizes the way in which historical, political, and social factors affect literary representations, with special focus on the diverse literatures of the African continent and their relationships to works from European (and U.S.) contexts.</p>

<h3 id="WCGICMLIT242">CMLIT 242 Francophone Literature in a World Context [WG]</h3><h4>Approved 2012-12-03</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Through poetry, essays, drama, and literary theory, the global presence of the French language (stemming from France’s history as a colonial power) and the creation of diverse Francophone cultures in Africa,the Americas, and the Indian Ocean, students will explore the complexities of cultural exchange and cultural resistance as an “unintended consequence” of colonialism.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Francophone literature provides a point of entry for the discussion of colonialism and postcolonialism, which has become increasingly a part of the college curriculum in recent years.  Given that the reverberations of such literary-political movements as Negritude continue to be felt in modern theories of Pan-Africanism and in struggles for equal rights around the world, the course will be relevant to anyone interested in the “Global South.”</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> The development of Francophone literature is intimately bound up with French colonialism, an imperial project carried out over several centuries and geographical areas (the Caribbean, North America, Africa, and Asia).  This course focuses on the diversity of literary responses to that historical phenomenon, which ranges from assimilationism to outright resistance.  The course can either have a broad global focus or concentrate on a single region (e.g., North Africa, the Caribbean, West and Central Africa, etc.).  All texts will be read in translation.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> The question of colonialism carries a particular polemical charge.  Most significant Francophone literature reflects the experiences of the colonized, expressed in the language of the colonizer.  Indigenous responses to colonialism employ rhetorical and discursive methods to undermine the colonial rationale.  Students in this course will be exposed to the “subaltern’s” position and will thus be in a position to evaluate the colonial project from the standpoint of its subjects as well as its exponents, as well as becoming more aware of the historical circumstances leading to the formation of the “Third World.”</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> The course will require students to write two short essays and a research paper, and to make an in-class presentation, based on the reading material and the issues discussed over the course of the semester.</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> Comparative Literature is intrinsically concerned with connections between cultures, and the shared experience of French colonialism forged global links among literary and political figures who were educated in the colonial system and who used that education to challenge it and propose new forms of coexistence based on equality rather than domination.  Literary study in this context also involves historical and political analysis.</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> The focus of the course could be on a single transnational literary-political movement (e.g., Negritude, as shown on the sample syllabus) or the literature of a region (North Africa, West Africa), with close attention paid to the specific histories of colonialism and postcolonialism.</p>
<p><strong>WG-4:</strong> The anti-colonial revolution in the Francophone world spanned continents, from Southeast Asia to the Indian Ocean to Africa and the Caribbean.  Studying the Francophone literary expressions of this historical moment (the Empire writing back to the metropole), particularly as many writers were also politically involved, provides a creative perspective on the anti-colonial and post-colonial worlds.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Utilizing critical readings, live and video observations of a wide variety of world dances, class discussions, participation in dance classes and research and writing assignments, students will gather information about dances, interpret the context and meaning of these works, compare and contrast their discoveries and write about their new understandings relative to their previous beliefs about dance.  Students will participate in a wide variety of discussions and activities that will enable the student to demonstrate their growing understanding of dance as a cultural and social activity steeped in the expression of values.  Video viewings and participation in different world dance forms will occur throughout the semester and the instructor will urge students to experience new ways of thinking about dance and culture asking them to compare and contrast dance forms and the context within which they function.  The professor will challenge students to think about the deeper motivations involved in dances, looking at their underlying cultural values.  In-class choreographic projects will challenge students to create dance studies that express personal values and culture, and will allow students to apply new ideas about dance, culture and values in a concrete way.  And, the ongoing journaling/blogging process will provide students a record of lectures, discussions and observations that they can utilize to write their final synthesis paper.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> A 7-page synthesis paper drawing on class experiences, video observations, readings and class discussions is required.  This paper will address dance as a carrier of cultural values.  Students will be asked to analyze a dance form familiar to them, relating it to class experiences and reflecting on it’s aesthetic value system; comparing and contrasting it with other world forms studied in class. This analysis must consider the dance form’s functions in society, and the evolution of this form from a historical perspective.   The students will be asked to provide full descriptive information about the dance forms, and to speculate about what information the dances being discussed provide about the values, concerns and culture of the choreographer and/or dancers. As a part of this discussion students will be asked to articulate a working definition of dance derived from class experience, viewings, readings, viewing a live performance, and their own prior knowledge.  Students will also present a dance of their own devising with a small group.  Students will be able to discuss their dance from a critical point of view explaining how they chose to represent the shared values within the group through movement.</p>

The students will be asked to provide full descriptive information about the dance forms, and to speculate about what information the dances being discussed provide about the values, concerns and culture of the choreographer and/or dancers. Special attention should be paid to appropriate contexts for comparison of analysis (social, theatrical, ethnic dances etc…) and movement traditions as they evolve over time and geographic location (diasporic dance traditions).</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>WG-4:</strong> In classroom discussions, journal entries, daily classroom assignments and in their final synthesis paper, students will closely examine African and African Diasporic Dances, looking at the importance of this track of movement culture as it is manifested in contemporary global dance culture.  Students will also look closely at early Baroque dance as it has evolved into Ballet and become the ancestor of much of what we consider western theatrical dancing today.</p>
<p><strong>WG-5:</strong> This class will explore the meanings of dance in a variety of cultural settings and the ways in which the interactions of cultures have engendered new dance forms.  Particular attention is given to the part African and African-American dance forms have played in shaping contemporary social and theatrical dance as we know it today.  Issues of cultural hierarchy, stereotyping, appropriation and marginalization will be addressed.  We will examine how the field of dance intersects with Sociology, Cultural Anthropology and Ethnomusicology.  Students will also discuss issues of race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality, and religion.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Previously approved for the Perspectives AP Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Previously approved for the Perspectives AP Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students will read both works of dramatic literature and secondary source materials (such as performance reviews, essays, textbook excerpts, manifestos) that evidence different points of view on what the theatre can and should be, and learn to interpret and assess this information in class discussions and on exams.  They will also gain experiential information through their participation in in-class exercises covering the building blocks of acting, playwriting and/or directing, and likewise interpret and assess this information in  class discussions and on exams. For example, students will read Aristotle’s Poetics to understand mimesis and catharsis, and also read theoretical writings by Bertolt Brecht to understand the opposite aims of puncturing theatrical illusion and leaving the audience wrestling with social problems. Readings from Antonin Artaud will offer a vision of theatre as sensory assault. In one class exercise, students will stage the first 10 lines of one of the assigned plays with attention to how placement of the audience and use of space affects the meaning and experience of the play. After viewing 5 different stagings, students will assess the importance of spatial configuration in constructing meaning.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Through participating in in-class critiques after exercises, participating in active discussion of class readings, and writing paragraphs on exams, students will be asked to evaluate the evidence and arguments contained in the course reading both critically and analytically. This course makes students confront historically critical debates over the purpose and value of theatre. For example, students will stage a scene from Death of a Salesman in Brechtian and Stanislavskian styles, and discuss the contrasting resonances for the audience. They will evaluate, among other things, whether Brecht’s arguments for the effectiveness of his production style are supported by their own responses to that style as audience members. What, if any, are the flaws in Brecht’s precepts?</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Over the course of the semester students will produce an essay on a theatrical subject, which will also incorporate elements of a performance review.  The review-essay will require a well-reasoned written argument with proper use of evidence. In addition, students will be asked to generate a written proposal prior to the creation of a final performance project, and in that proposal argue effectively for the feasibility and relevance of what they wish to achieve on stage. For example, in a performance review-essay on a production of Hamlet, students will need to produce descriptive writing as evidence, using accurate, evocative language to capture the performance, as well as other evidence in the form of citations from the original text, to build their argument about the merits and particular viewpoint of the production.  They will also be asked to evaluate the choices of the actor playing Hamlet in light of core concepts in Theatre Studies, for example Aristotle’s characterization of the ideal tragic hero.</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> Students will apply the concepts and methods of Theatre Studies to their reading of world dramatic literature and theory and also apply the concepts and methods in their review-essay and on their exams. For example, this course explores such key concepts of theatre studies as genre, acting methodology, directorial interpretation, visualization through theatrical design, mimesis, and the nature of dramatic structure, character, theme and theatrical language.</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> Students will analyze dramatic literature, actor training, and/or stagecraft from at least three different world cultures. For example, students will study a Shakespearean play, learn the fundamentals of speaking verse on stage, and understand the mechanics of the Elizabethan stage and how Elizabethan theatre functioned in the political and social context of the time.  They will also learn about the nature of Kathakali play narratives and their relation to larger Indian epics, experiment with the basic mudras (hand gestures) of Kathakali and how they function as a language, and likewise discover the mechanics of the Kathakali stage and how it operates in its larger cultural context. Students will also understand the evolution of the ancient Greek theatre and the increasing dominance of actors as time passed. They will experiment with masks and understand how they both limit and liberate the performer, and consider what changes in a society are necessary before masks are replaced by faces. Thus, students will study the process and significance of theatrical presentation from the points of view of diverse societies.</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>WG-4:</strong> Students will analyze the significance of major cultural movements which have helped shape the theatrical manifestation of aesthetics, politics, and self-understanding in world societies. Such movements in the West include classicism, the Renaissance, romanticism, realism, naturalism, absurdism and postmodernism. For example, if we say that drama is based on conflict, how do dramatic models of conflict change with changes, from society to society, in the definition of a human being’s relation to the world?</p>
<p><strong>WG-5:</strong> Students will examine the ways in which race, ethnicity, class, and gender have been portrayed on stage, and how portrayals of these and other forms of social differentiation help shape the way a culture or society does (or doesn’t) accommodate and understand social difference. For instance, in focusing on the representation of gender on stage, students will look at the different implications of cross-gender casting in ancient Greece, Elizabethan England and Kathakali. Why were women prevented from performing in so many of the world’s classic theatres? What did male writers and performers seek to accomplish in their portrayals of women?</p>

<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> In this course, global education policy is present from the point of view of human capital economics, democratic schooling, socialist schooling, indigenous schooling, liberation education, indigenous education, and human rights education. Students learn the differences between these varied approaches to global education policy. In addition, students consider the political role in shaping global education policies of global education businesses, the World Bank, OECD, and the United Nations along with nongovernment organizations, such as environmental, human rights, the World Economic Forum, and professional organizations.</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>WG-4:</strong> This course is devoted to examining a variety of education movements and their effect on shaping global education policies, including human capital economics, democratic schooling, socialist schooling, indigenous schooling, liberation education, indigenous education, and human rights education.</p>
<p><strong>WG-5:</strong> Each one of the various approaches to global education policy discussed in the course touches on these issues. For instance, human rights education explicitly deals with issues of race, ethnicity, class, gender, language, and beliefs. Authoritarian forms of education, discussed in the course, explicitly try to curb human rights, particularly in the realm of sexual orientation, language, ethnicity, and class. Human capital education theorists deal specifically with the issues of income class and equality of opportunity. Indigenous education proposals deal specifically with past attempts to destroy cultures and languages along with ethnic discrimination. In the class, I propose a global list of educational rights, which includes rights related to race, ethnicity, class, gender, language, sexual orientation, and religious beliefs.</p>

<h3 id="WCGIENGL157">ENGL 157 Readings in Global Literatures in English [WG LIT]</h3><h4>Approved 2015-05-24</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Knowledge is acquired through in-class discussions, writing assignments, readings, and the occasional lecture. The course data is the assigned reading, which is composed of both primary and secondary sources: novels, poems, stories, essays, and scholarly articles. Students are asked to answer questions in class through instructor-led discussions, in informal writing assignments (in class and online), and in formal essays assignments where they are asked to demonstrate that they understand and can synthesize the material covered.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Literary Studies, and particular the study of Global Literature, gives students a lens through which to understand some of the major concerns of a liberal arts curriculum: students are taught to read closely and critically, to think about how texts reflect historical and current events, to understand the human condition, and to appreciate the aesthetics of writing. Acquiring these skills will give students a better understanding of world culture, art, and politics, and ideally, make them critical thinkers and leaders.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> The global focus on this course requires instructors to choose literary and secondary sources from across the world. Students will be asked to read literature and essays from a number of English-speaking countries, from different eras, and from various points of view. The focus of this course is comparative, and one of the goals of this course is to understand how things like gender, race, class, ethnicity, sexuality, language, and belief are represented differently across time and nation.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> As an English course, one of the major goals of this class is to learn to evaluate evidence through close reading, class discussion, and focused writing assignments. Students are then taught to use that evidence to write formal essays that make critical arguments about a text or series of texts that show they a) know how to formulate coherent arguments b) synthesize material covered in class and c) use evidence to support their arguments.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Through in-class discussions, informal writing assignments, and formal essays students will be asked to make coherent arguments using the assigned text (or texts) as evidence. Some sections of this class may also assign oral presentations and/ or exams where students will be asked to show they understand the texts and how to use them to make larger arguments about world culture.</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> Close reading, critical analysis, and argument-driven writing are some of the fundamental methods of literary studies. In this class, students will be taught these skills to understand how world literature reflects issues of globalization, how transnational and post-colonial writers use and critique the English language, and how the concept of global literature has challenged the processes of canon formation.</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> As a global literature class, this course will assign literary texts that reflect different cultural and historical perspectives. Students will learn how different cultures use language and create literature as a response to their cultural and historical imperatives. Additionally, literary texts are an excellent way to teach students about the subjective nature of perspective, and one of the outcomes of a class on global literature will be to show students how a point of view is historically and culturally constructed through effective and powerful rhetoric.</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>WG-4:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>WG-5:</strong> The texts assigned in a global English literature course will necessarily think about how the English language has been appropriated by different cultures, according to time and nation. Additionally, since the class requires a diverse array of literatures, one of its focuses will be to understand how identity markers— such a gender, ethnicity, race, and religion— are reflected in literary productions and/ or respond to particular historical or cultural shifts in a society. Much of class discussion and writing assignments will focus on drawing students’ attention to how literature reflects and responds to social and culture difference.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Students will learn and apply the methods and vocabulary of close reading and literary stylistics, two key approaches in the field of French literature.  They begin the semester answering questions about individual works of literature on the online bulletin board.  As their skill in literary analysis develops, they formulate their own questions and answers related to works on the syllabus.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Knowledge of French or another language other than English is an essential part of the liberal arts curriculum in that it allows students to engage directly with works of literature from Francophone cultures and to understand them in their linguistic context.  In written assignments, students address the influence of ideas and approaches from other disciplines on the study of literature.  Since the literary works on the syllabus are drawn from different historical periods, cultural traditions, and literary movements, students analyze in writing and discussion the impact of historical, artistic, linguistic, and political phenomena on literary genres and techniques.  Written assignments require students to reflect on the role of literature in the French language in Francophone countries, in the U.S., and in the world.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students are required to gather, interpret and evaluate French-language sources from a variety of domains, including reference works, the internet, literature, and historical texts.  Each session is organized around the discussion and analysis of a work of literature. In-class discussion, exams, written assignments, and bulletin board postings require students to engage in close reading and base their answers to questions on specific formal and linguistic characteristics of the work under consideration.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> In course discussions and exam questions, students read and critique texts in French written by French writers as well as by authors from Francophone Africa, the Caribbean, and Quebec.  Students evaluate arguments critically by completing peer-review of their classmates’ writing on the online bulletin board.</p>

<h3 id="WCGIFREN370">FREN 370 Topics in Francophone Literature [WG LIT LANG]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-04-16</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> During the course of the semester, students will examine a number of different critical approaches (feminist, Marxist, formalist, post-colonial, etc.) to Francophone fiction and use these readings as models for their own written analysis of works on the syllabus.  Students identify and analyze relationships between literary discourse, genres, and historical/cultural context.  In class discussions and on exams, students apply the methods and vocabulary of close reading and literary stylistics, key approaches in the field of French literature. Students formulate informed questions on the literary texts on the syllabus before each class meeting.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Knowledge of French or another language other than English is an essential part of the liberal arts curriculum in that it allows students to engage directly with works of literature from Francophone cultures and understand them in their linguistic and cultural contexts.  In reading and written assignments, students address the influence of ideas and approaches from other disciplines (art, music, sociology, history, political science, philosophy, psychology) on the study of literature.  Since the literary works on the syllabus are drawn from different geographic areas, historical moments, cultural traditions, and literary movements, students analyze in writing and discussion the impact of historical, artistic, linguistic, and political phenomena on the evolution of literary genres and techniques.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> In class discussions, students critique texts in French drawn from multiple genres written by authors from Francophone Africa, the Caribbean, Asia, and Quebec. In preparation for their final research project, students gather, interpret, and evaluate French and English-language sources from a variety of domains, including reference works, literature, literary and cultural criticism, and historical texts.  Students evaluate arguments and evidence critically by completing peer-review of early drafts of their classmates’ final research projects.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> In class discussions, students critique texts in French drawn from multiple genres written by authors from Francophone Africa, the Caribbean, Asia, and Quebec. In preparation for their final research project, students gather, interpret and evaluate French and English-language primary and secondary sources from a variety of domains, including reference works, literature, literary and cultural criticism, and historical texts.  Students evaluate arguments and evidence critically by completing peer-review of early drafts of their classmates’ final research projects.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> On exams and in their final research project, students must defend their insights and support their theses with well-reasoned arguments as well as direct references to literary texts and secondary critical sources.  Students learn to recognize and improve flawed arguments through peer and instructor review of early drafts of their final research project.  In class discussions, students must defend their interpretations of literary texts in the French language.</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> Francophone literature exists in a unique relationship with colonialism and post-colonialism in that an author’s choice to write in the French language represents a choice to maintain, yet transform the language of the former colonial power. Students are asked in class discussions and on exams to compare the different representations of global artistic, geographic or political phenomena such as Surrealism, natural disasters, or economic imperialism in texts drawn from Francophone Caribbean, African, North American, and French writers. Written assignments require students to reflect on the role of literature in the French language in Francophone countries, in the U.S., and in the world.</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>WG-4:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>WG-5:</strong> Since the literary works on the syllabus are drawn from multiple geographic areas, historical periods, cultural traditions, and literary movements, students are asked to analyze in writing and discussion the impact of these differences in Francophone literatures.  Reading, exam questions, and class discussion require students to analyze literature in French produced by writers from diverse cultures, races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, religions, and backgrounds. This allows them to appreciate and engage critically with representations of diversity in France’s former colonies and worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>WG-6:</strong> Students reflect orally and in writing on the interaction between language and society in Francophone literature.  The consistent use of French in the classroom, practice in close reading in French, written analyses of French texts, and a final research project based on critical appreciation of works of literature and critical analysis in French enable students to understand and articulate the relationship between creative use of language, creation of meaning, and transformations of cultural values in French-speaking countries.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Previously approved for the Perspectives CV Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Previously approved for the Perspectives CV Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students study cultural artifacts, critical analyses, literature, film, and historical texts in order to better understand the formation, evolution, and impact of French cultural beliefs, practices, and products.  Students also examine these developments within transnational and global contexts. On exam questions and in a final paper, students demonstrate their ability to identify, synthesize, and analyze documents from a variety of sources and points of view.  They use their understanding of the historical contexts to evaluate the contributions and limitations of cultural artifacts to the study of cultures.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Assignments ask students to demonstrate their masterful application of various analytical approaches of Cultural Studies to the course material.  Exam questions and online discussions require students to interpret and critique texts reflecting a variety of perspectives (colonial, anti-colonial, Marxist, capitalist, feminist, etc.)  In reaction papers, students are asked to assess and appreciate social, economic, gender, race, and class context in their analysis of original sources.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Each student is responsible for leading an online discussion of assigned reading and will present questions raised or answered by the assigned reading of a historical or literary text.  The online discussion forms the starting point for class discussion of the assigned reading. Students draft responses to exam questions where they refer to key concepts and course readings to support their arguments and conclusions.  The final paper requires students to use primary and secondary sources to support their analysis of an aspect of French and/or Francophone culture. For instance, students may provide arguments for four primary questions: What were the ideological imperatives and cultural attitudes that motivated French colonial expansion?  How did the encounter with new geographies and non-Western societies influence the French literary imagination?  What distinct forms of writings emerged?  How does the memory of the colonial experience participate in contemporary debates around “Frenchness,” citizenship, and representation within France and the ;arger “Francophone” world?</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> In exam questions, class discussions, essays, and an original term paper, students apply analytical methods of Cultural Studies to analyze the beliefs, practices, and productions of France and the Francophone world.  They may, for instance, be asked to examine how the ideas and practices presented in Enlightenment texts reflect political, economic, and social developments in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas.  An online discussion may use a theoretical essay and documentary to address the psycho-social effects of colonization on both colonizer and colonized.  Class discussions ask students to evaluate the relationship between culture and politics within French-speaking societies, as well as, their own lives.  In their final paper, students complete an in-depth analysis of a particular aspect of French and/or Francophone culture based on primary and secondary sources.</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> Students examine important developments in French history as it related to the international and global context of overseas expansion. Essay topics ask students to discuss the role of religion and the French language in the colonization process from the point of view of the colonizer and the colonized (or formerly colonized.)  The role of “La Francophonie” and its relationship to globalization is analyzed orally and in writing. They relationship between colonial expansion and the development of academic disciplines (i.e. geography, botany, and anthropology) and the analytical tools and arguments they contributed to the imperial project are discussed.</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> The course examines the formation and evolution of cultural and political institutions in France within the internationl and global context of overseas expansion in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Through their responses to exam questions, students demonstrate their understanding of historical, economic, and social factors influencing this relationship.  Both European and non-European perspectives are presented through primary and secondary material.</p>
<p><strong>WG-4:</strong> The course examines the role of key historical, political, and cultural developments that have shaped the modern world, including capitalism, imperialism, the rise of Fascism, Romanticism, Surrealism, Negritude, decolonization, Existentialism, and globalization.  Moreover, class discussions and assignments examine the impact and expression of these movements on the creative arts (literature, film, music).  Students also examine how these developments are discussed and remembered within France and its (former) colonies.  For instance, students answer exam questions requiring them to examine he continuing impact of the Algerian war of independence on French and world cultures.</p>
<p><strong>WG-5:</strong> Through the study of texts from France’s former colonies in Africa and the Caribbean, students analyze and discuss the evolving role race, ethnicity, gender, class, religion, and sexual orientation play in France itself, and in its former colonies. For instance, in discussions of French Revolution, students study letters exchanged between France’s Napoléon Bonaparte and the leader of the Haitian Revolution Toussaint Louverture.  They examine how, say, each political figure used the epistolary form to both express and conceal their respective visions for Haiti, and attitudes towards race, slavery, and independence.  They use perspectives and debates about social differentiation in the development and formulation of ideas of citizenship, sovereignty, and civil liberties within Francophone cultures and societies.</p>

In addition, visual material such as paintings and woodcuts will be scrutinized, and literature will also be explored in terms of how it may reveal the values and mentalities of a given society. Students will be encouraged to investigate the biases and agendas that define these sources, and to contextualize them in accordance with their secondary source reading.</p>

Students will be encouraged to investigate the biases and agendas that define these sources, and to contextualize them in accordance with their secondary source reading.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> In papers as well as oral reports/arguments, students will be encouraged to debate key points in early modern history: examples will center upon the religious changes of the reformation (beneficial or disastrous in the development of Christianity or society at large); the Enlightenment (enlightened, or not); the scientific revolution (negative/positive, especially in relation to applied science, as in warfare, industrialism, etc).</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> The early modern period itself gave rise to the modern historical discipline, its method defined by the critical analysis of sources, or the idea (however questioned now) of objective critical detachment; indeed, the past was viewed on quite different terms before. Not only will students come to understand the practice of history, but so will they explore the manner in which the purview of historians has broadened over time to include other groups and sub-fields (for example, history of mentalities, gender history, history-and-memory, social history).</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> This course will devote considerable time to three points of globalization in the early modern world (1500-1815): exploration and encounters with the new world, including the establishment of colonies; the emergence of empires (British, French) and their economic reach; and the related rise of global warfare (the Seven Years’ War, Napoleon), and its impact on societies. Emphasis will rest on the effects of these developments on indigenous populations, manifested in political, economic, and cultural terms.</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> Though some weight will be given to the lasting influence of early modern Europe, the period will be assessed in terms of the profound differences that also underlay a distinctly different, pre-modern society. Questions will encompass the following historical development: what ideas propelled religious persecution and warfare, and how did notions of plurality and toleration then emerge in the later seventeenth century? How were popular politics, including riots and rebellions, expressed by the people, and treated by authorities?  How did absolutism develop as a political idea, in opposition to the constitutionalism that underlay the British and U.S. system of government? What role did women play in historical developments of the period?</p>
<p><strong>WG-4:</strong> All the major events and developments that marked the early modern period will be examined through the prism of the different viewpoints of those who experienced them.  Examples include the reaction to the reformation by peasants versus the elites; the vocies of women and radicals in the English Civil War; the response of the Irish or the American Indians to their own subjugation; early slave narratives; and the many ideological responses to the  French Revolution.</p>
<p><strong>WG-5:</strong> This course emphasizes the shared and distinct symbols, patterns, values, and meanings that were bound up in early modern Europe cultural systems, and the manner in which society shaped and was shaped by such organizing principles as religion, an emergent scientific culture, or political systems.  In turn, the transformation of these systems, in the transition from early modernity to modernity, will also be explored, especially through the impact it had, for example, on family and kin structures, or on developments, for example, in crime and punishment.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives SS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives SS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> In each of two primary source essays, students are required to research the author and the historical context of a given document, to interpret the text and its subtext from the point of view of both its author and its contemporary audience, as well as to assess the document’s significance for a present-day audience. In exam essays, students must gather evidence from a variety of course materials to support a claim, which makes some synthetic assessment, taking into account how a given historical event or movement differently affects different social groups (by class, gender, race, nationality, etc).</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> In course discussions, students are asked to consider a variety of premises and how historical evidence can and cannot support them (for example, in a class day focused on Fascism, students are presented with basic defining features of the movement, then asked to compare these defining features of historical Fascism with at least two contemporary documents that helped to develop the ideology — such as Mussolini’s “What is Fascism?” and excerpts from Mein Kampf — and to analyze for themselves the degree to which Fascism varied across Europe — from Germany to Estonia to Romania to Italy and beyond — and how it compared and contrasted with contemporary manifestations of Communism and democratic capitalism, based on the evidence they have at hand). Students are then asked to re-create this process of applying evidence and assessing its value through exam essay questions (for example, and essay may ask students to compare Hitler’s Germany to Stalin’s Russia, focusing on specific policies and ideologies, and then ask students to assess how this process adds to our understanding of either regime).</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> In both primary source interpretation essays and in-class exam essays, students are expected to articulate a substantive, specific, and contestable main claim addressing a major question of historical interpretation, and to support that claim with evidence from course materials, in clear, correct prose. For example, to address an essay question about the fate of capitalism and socialism in Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, students should examine primary-source documents defining these ideas in specific contexts (such as Marx’s Communist Manifesto and Smiles’ “Self-Help”), secondary-source and lecture materials on how these economic experiments actually manifested themselves, as well as first-hand historical accounts of how these phenomena were experienced (such as Engels’s description of industrial Manchester). Students must organize these forms of evidence to create a coherent narrative of cause/effect or continuity/change, explaining why and how socialism/Communism was attempted in some places or times and rejected in others, and likewise for capitalism.</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> History 102 covers, in readings and discussions, how the discipline of history was first professionalized in the nineteenth century as part of a larger process of positivism, urbanization, and middle-class professionalization. The course asks students to practice the basic methods of history by writing an analysis of a historical primary source (the basic building block of historical inquiry), by analyzing cause and effect or continuity and change over time in a given historical context (the underlying logical framework that defines our discipline), which they do in exam essays, and finally they are asked to reflect on their own place in the discipline of history and the liberal arts in a final reflection essay.</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> When we study European Imperialism and decolonization (key defining events of modern globalization), we address the confrontation between what was perceived as a European civilization and the many non-European cultures that fell under European domination in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Students read about Imperialism and decolonization in several primary texts as well as the textbook overview, and discuss the critical analytical issues involved in class. Imperialism and decolonization are then included among the subjects tested in exams, and are an optional subject for the primary source essays. Throughout the course students compare developments in the countries covered, and study the development of different points of view in various social groups. For example, students read multiple primary-source accounts of a given event (such as Friedrich Engels’s critique of industrialization on behalf of workers and Ure’s middle-class defense of it). Students also analyze several points of view in the primary source essays, which ask students to examine the point of view of the author of a given document, his/her contemporary audience, and the point of view of a present-day historian, at a minimum; in exam essay questions, students are asked to compare causes, effects, and other developments across time, place, or social category (for example, in an essay on the effects of the industrial revolution, students are asked how different social classes, and men and women, were affected differently).</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> History 102 is defined as an analysis of the historical development of the 50+ societies of modern Europe. Students are asked to specifically compare developments in writing in exam essays such as “compare Britain and Germany in the decades of their rivalry culminating in World War I, with particular attention to how each country articulated its own sense of national identity and mission vis-à-vis the rest of the world” or questions comparing Fascist Germany and Stalinist Russia, or analyzing how nationalism, capitalism, or socialism developed differently in different parts of Europe.</p>
<p><strong>WG-4:</strong> In exam essays and primary source papers as well as class discussions, students analyze the significance of such major social movements as liberalism, unionism, conservatism, nationalism, Romanticism, Social Darwinism, imperialism/hypernationalism, organized racism, anti-Semitism, feminism, pacifism, modernism, socialism, Soviet Communism, Stalinism, Fascism, Naziism, and decolonization, all of which are defining movements of modern world history.</p>
<p><strong>WG-5:</strong> Embedded throughout the readings, assignments, lectures and classroom discussion of History 102 are analyses of how race, ethnicity, class, gender and ideology (both secular and religious) have formed the history of modern Europe. Primary source readings, in particular, are included in part in order to bring voices of varying social and intellectual background into the forefront of the historical narrative (these readings are discussed in class and then students write two thorough analyses). It is a fundamental assumption of the discipline that social categories such as race, nationality, class, and gender are constructed and change over time and place. The history of modern Europe is taught as the process of how people have constructed and changed the meaning of key social categories over time and place. Just a few examples include the rise of the working class after industrialization, the unification of Italy and Germany under the influence of popular nationalism, the rise of the women’s rights movement in response to the rhetoric of natural rights, the development of socialism, Fascism, and Communism in response to perceived economic inequities, and the expansion of European powers into overseas empires based on conceptions of racial difference. All student work in History 102 – from participation in discussion to each formal written assignment – is expected to reflect their understanding of the role of social categories like race, class, and gender in change over time in modern Europe (for example, an exam essay question might ask students to analyze the different ways nationalism developed in Germany as opposed to Britain, or in the late nineteenth century versus the interwar period, or how European ideas about race were used as a justification for imperial expansion).</p>

<p><strong>QC-2:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives SS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> The instructor selects 3-4 topics (hot topics) important in today’s geo-political world for students to follow regularly on the news, update in individual presentations to the class, and discuss and analyze weekly in class, giving some consideration to the sources of information.  Students also analyze primary source documents (all written materials are in translation) throughout the course of the semester. Such documents include Persian and Mughal miniature paintings, Chinese scrolls, Buddhist statuary in Dunhuang and formerly in Bamiyan.  Students analyze incidents in history using texts as well.  Finally, each student researches a topic of individual interest, submit 4 writing assignments on that topic, and orally presents final findings for the class to discuss and analyze. These research papers are focused on the modern or contemporary period.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> The weekly hot topic discussions will involve critical analysis, but even more so, the students’ papers and formal presentations described above will be evaluated on critical argumentation.  Students evaluate primary source documents including visual and textual materials.  In one particular example students analyze the Great Game quest for empire in Central Asia.  The evidence consists of cartoons, formal portraits of leaders, and texts, including and a case study of a legal incident that took place in Peshawar in which a cobra kills a member of the British constabulary, resulting in the snake charmer’s imprisonment and the death of the cobra.  Through this study, students explore extraterritoriality, race, and justice.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> The course involves both written and oral assignments, all of which must include primary source evidence and reasoned conclusions.  Students debate aspects of historical case studies and also of vexed issues in today’s world as they relate to course content.  In one such example students debated the expansion of the mosque/community center at Ground Zero, as they learned the historical origins of Islam and traced its development along the Silk Road.</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> The course is self-evidently global in perspective.  Mainly, students will come to understand history and of historiography.   They also learn about the ways in which the purview of historians has expanded to include as topics such as intellectual history, gender history, and historical memory. We consider the Neolithic Revolution at the start, which involves anthropology as much as history, and we move on to notions of tradition and modernity, which will mix history with sociology.  Issues of religion and magic will engage cultural studies.</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> Among other processes, students explore physical and human geography, including the interaction of empires, nomads, and oasis towns.  For example, we will examine the Silk Road from different points of view, such as those that involve economic impact, religious syncretism, and experiences of ethnicity.  As another example, we analyze empire-building practices in both China and under the Mongols</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> This course studies the interplay of nomads (examples used are Yueh-chih, Xiongnu and Mongols), oasis towns (such as Kashgar, Samarkand and Bukhara) and empires (such as China and the Safavid) along the Silk Road.  The course also explores the central area of the Silk Road through a study of the development of today’s Afghanistan and the role it has played in the center of the Silk Road through history.   One modern/contemporary case study focuses on the resource-rich Caspian Sea area and the role Iran and  other surrounding nations play in extracting or blocking the extraction of resources from the Sea.</p>
<p><strong>WG-4:</strong> This course analyzes the significance of several major movements that have moved along the Silk Road.  One primary focus of the course is the interplay of religions such as Confucianism (which is a system of statecraft), Buddhism and Islam, the way this interplay has shaped societies along the Silk Road.  A second focus is on ways in which empire-building and nationalism have shaped the societies along the Silk Road.  A third focus is on contemporary problems such as water use and abuse, diseases such as HIV and SARs, and drugs such as heroin.  Please see the syllabus for others.</p>
<p><strong>WG-5:</strong> The course focuses on the foundations of race, ethnicity, class, gender, language, and belief systems in the different cultures along the Silk Road.   Students select one such topic as a focus of his/her individual research and submits his/her study in the form of writing assignments.  Selected topics popular among the students are:  the changing status of women before and after the Iranian revolution; the changing status of women before and after the Chinese revolution; the comparative lifestyle of Kurds in four Asian nations, and the Kurdish quest for statehood; the expansion of heroin cultivation in Afghanistan during the period of American involvement; and  the role of religion (Sunni-Shi’a) in foreign relations between Iran and Iraq.</p>
<p><strong>WG-6:</strong> Students learn some Chinese language throughout the course.  This is not a language course.  However, the instructor uses Chinese language to illustrate aspects of Chinese culture as related to the course.  One such  example is the term for “benevolence.” the primary Confucian virtue at the time of Confucius.  The word is 仁 (“man” and “two”) and is described in the following phrase: Do not unto others what you would not have others do until you.  Another illustrative Chinese word is the word for family 家 which consists of a pig under a roof, of the word for peace 安 which consists of a woman under a roof.  In this way, students come to understand some basic values of China.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> In this course students review and extend their mastery of Italian grammar and vocabulary through a variety of oral and writing assignments. Students are also exposed to culturally relevant materials (selections from Italian literary and non literary texts, as well as movies). Through the study and practice of grammar and vocabulary students gain awareness of the cognitive processes involved in adult second-language acquisition and identify and articulate the advantages and challenges encountered by adult second language learners. Through readings and discussions of cultural materials, students enhance their Italian language proficiency and broaden their understanding of Italian culture and history.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Italian is one of the European languages particularly relevant to the Queens College student body, which includes a considerable number of heritage speakers with proficiency in their respective local Italian dialects, but a less well-developed mastery of modern standard Italian. In addition, knowledge of Italian or another language other than English is an essential part of the liberal arts curriculum in that it allows students to engage directly with cultural productions from another culture and to understand them in their linguistic and social context. Written assignments require students to reflect on the place of the Italian language in both Italy and the United States, as well as on the relevance of Italian cultural productions across time to our twenty-first century realities. Knowledge of one or more foreign languages is a valuable asset for students considering graduate school or seeking employment in the international field. Italian is particularly useful for students who are pursuing careers in education, translation/interpreting, international business and law, journalism, travel, and hospitality, among others.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students are required to gather and interpret information from authentic Italian audio-visual and print sources, both literary and non-literary, for in-class oral and written activities.

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students study cultural artifacts, critical analyses, literature, film, and historical texts in order to better understand the formation, evolution, and impact of Italian cultural beliefs, practices, and products.  Students also examine these developments within transnational and global contexts. On exam questions and in a final paper, students demonstrate their ability to identify, synthesize, and analyze documents from a variety of sources and points of view.  They use their understanding of the historical contexts to evaluate the contributions and limitations of cultural artifacts to the study of cultures.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Assignments ask students to demonstrate their masterful application of various analytical approaches of Cultural Studies to the course material.  Exam questions and online discussions require students to interpret and critique texts reflecting a variety of perspectives. In reaction papers, students are asked to assess and appreciate social, economic, gender, race, and class context in their analysis of original sources.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Each student is responsible for leading an in-class discussion of assigned reading and will present questions raised or answered by the assigned reading of a historical or literary text.  The presentation forms the starting point for in-class discussion of the assigned reading. Students draft responses to exam questions where they refer to key concepts and course readings to support their arguments and conclusions.  The final paper requires students to use primary and secondary sources to support their analysis of an aspect of Italian culture.</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> In exam questions, class discussions, essays, and an original term paper, students apply analytical methods of Cultural Studies to analyze the beliefs, practices, and productions of Italy. They may, for instance, be asked to examine how the ideas and practices presented in texts produced before the unification of Italy reflect political, economic, and social developments in the “Italian” mainland and islands, as well as across the Mediterranean world of the time. Students may also be asked to examine the social, linguistic, political, and cultural process and implications of Italian unification; the history of Italy during World War II and the post-war period; and the challenges facing Italians in the 21st century. Class discussions ask students to evaluate the relationship between culture and politics in both Italy and their own lives. In their final paper, students complete an in-depth analysis of a particular aspect of Italian culture based on primary and secondary sources.</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> Students examine important developments in Italian history as it relates to the international and global context in the past and today. Essay topics ask students to discuss the role of religion, politics, and the Italian language in the Medieval, Renaissance, “Risorgimento”, and/or post-Unification periods from a variety of points of view.</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> The course examines the formation and evolution of cultural and political institutions in Italy within international and global contexts (the Mediterranean, the Americas, Asia and Africa). Through their responses to exam questions, students demonstrate their understanding of historical, economic, and social factors influencing this relationship.  Both European and non-European perspectives are presented through primary and secondary material.</p>
<p><strong>WG-4:</strong> The course examines the role of key historical, political, and cultural developments that have shaped the modern world, including mercantilism, capitalism, the rise of Fascism, Romanticism, Futurism, and globalization.  Moreover, class discussions and assignments examine the impact and expression of these movements on the creative arts (literature, film, music).  Students also examine how these developments are discussed and remembered within Italy.</p>
<p><strong>WG-5:</strong> Through the study of Italian literary and non-literary texts, students analyze and discuss the evolving role that race, ethnicity, gender, class, religion, and sexual orientation continue to play in Italy. In discussions of medieval, early-modern, modern, and/or contemporary Italian culture, students study authentic documents and secondary essays on Italian mercantile culture across the Mediterranean, the “Southern Question,” gender roles, the history of Italian dialects and modern standard Italian, among other questions.</p>

<h3 id="WCGIKOR305">KOR 305 Advanced Korean I [WG LANG]</h3><h4>Approved 2016-12-12</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Language is a complex system of multiple sub-systems such as phonetics, vocabulary, and grammar, which have their own governing rules. As a native speaker of at least one language, we all have certain knowledge, whether implicit or explicit, on the phonetics, vocabulary, and grammar systems of our language, and thus this knowledge is readily applicable to foreign languages we learn. Using their knowledge on language as a system of systems, students are encouraged to attempt to generalize sound patterns, morphological rules, and grammatical patterns based on the language input they are given from the audio/video/textual materials and instructors. They are also encouraged to identify exceptions and irregular forms to their generalizations and learn about how to effectively deal with them. In doing so, students are asked to compare the structural properties of Korean with those of their own language to better understand the distinctive characteristics of Korean sound, word, and sentence structures.
Language is also a tool for communication which reflects the social customs and cultural uniqueness. Students are taught to understand that language should be not just grammatically correct and meaningful but also socio-culturally adequate and natural. Therefore, students should always ask: What is the best translation? Is it the most accurate? The most complete? Or the one that is most natural and adequate? Students will find answers to these questions regarding communicative and cultural aspects of the Korean language by gathering information from the audio/video/textual course materials, learning from lectures/explanations by instructors, and participating in the conversational and presentational activities.
All Korean language courses also aims to equip students with a certain level of fluency. With practice, language becomes easier to use. In fact, ease of use in an increasing number of contexts is one way to characterize fluency. Therefore, students will constantly ask themselves about the effective ways of language learning: How do we improve our fluency? Learn more words? Become more culturally aware? Does practice make perfect? Students are required to do a variety of assignments and will learn by experience what are the best or most effective practices for them.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> In general, language is of central importance to all human interaction. Even the adaptation of the notion of “text” to films, music, etc extends the metaphor of language to non-verbal domains. Therefore, it should be a given that a course of instruction that is dedicated to raising awareness of such a central human activity has a place in a liberal arts curriculum.
In particular, Korean, as a foreign language, opens up the possibility for students to learn more about the Korean-speaking society, whether they are more into the language per se or other disciplines such as politics, history, pop-culture, literature, philosophy, business, or even science and engineering. Knowledge of Korean allows students to engage directly with cultural productions from the area(s) where the language is spoken and to understand them in their linguistic and social context. Also, knowledge of one or more foreign languages is a valuable asset for students considering graduate school or seeking employment in the international field. Therefore, it can be concluded that Korean is an essential part of the liberal arts curriculum.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Referring to the reading materials in the textbook and workbook and/or using authentic media sources (e.g., literature, film, news articles and clips, library data, statistics, tables and graphs) provided by the instructor, students gather, interpret, and assess information on a variety of topics related to the Korean language and culture. 
Also, students often seek out materials of interest to them, extract information, analyze the content, and compare it with information available in their own language.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> By participating in a variety of interpretive and interpersonal communication activities such as pair/group discussions/conversations, role plays, and actual conversation with native speakers of Korean, students gain knowledge on how to communicate in the Korean language in grammatically correct, semantically natural, pragmatically adequate, and culturally accepted ways in a given situation.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students are often asked to produce short or long written or oral arguments on cultural differences between Korea and other societies where they use evidence drawn from various sources such as reading materials in the textbook and workbook, news media, literature, films to support their ideas. For instance, after watching a video clip on job interviews in Korea students may be asked to write a reaction essay in Korean or discuss with their classmates on what constitutes best practices in job interviews in Korea or what are the differences between American and Korean cultural practices. This can be done in English and/or Korean in lower level courses but entirely in Korean with precise vocabulary and adequate grammatical structures in upper level courses.</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> As discussed earlier, language is not just a structural system but also a tool for communication reflecting social customs and cultural uniqueness. Students are taught to understand that language should be not just grammatically correct and meaningful but also socio-culturally adequate and natural. In Korean language courses students naturally acquire comparative perspectives on world languages and cultures since they perceive similarities and differences between Korean language/culture and their own languages/cultures.

In beginning level courses, students compare aspects of Korean and their own cultures in terms of cultural products (e.g., food, songs, games, folktales, holiday celebrations), manners and daily routines (e.g., greetings, table manners, dwelling, showing respect to elders), gestures and expression through physical contacts (e.g., bowing vs. waving, hugging), daily life (e.g., school schedules, weekend activities, vacations), etc. [But, note that KOR101&amp;102 Elementary Korean I&amp;II are excluded from this justification because they are 4 credit courses and our Korean program has no intention to change them into 3 credit courses.]

In intermediate level courses, students compare aspects of Korean and their own cultures in terms of public facilities and services (public transportation, market, hospital, postal services), college life (interaction with teachers, extracurricular activities, social gatherings), special rites (e.g., wedding, funeral), folk beliefs and practices, etc.

In advanced level courses students analyze, discuss, and understand Korean cultural perspectives regarding familial and generational relationships manifested in respect for elders, importance of birth order, family responsibilities and duties, parental sacrifice for children, and filial obligations in comparison with their own cultural perspectives. Students compare and contrast in detail the significance of proverbs and idiomatic expressions used in Korean culture with the use in their own culture. Students analyze and discuss the roles and functions of major social institutions and infrastructure (e.g., education systems, religious institutions, types of retail shopping). They also compare ways of networking in social groups and institutions such as schools and work places and understand the internal dynamics among the members. Students also compare and contrast Korean folktales, short stories, and historical narratives with those of their own culture.

Students are also encouraged to use one’s own knowledge and methods they have acquired through their major/minor courses to explore and analyze the Korean culture and society.</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> A foreign language is a window to another culture. This does not just mean that you need to learn a language to better understand the society in which the language is spoken, but it also means that the culture is encoded in the structure and usage of the language. This is why we teach the culture when we teach a language. By learning not just the sound and grammar but also various fundamental characteristics of the Korean culture, students develop a more sophisticated knowledge on the grammar and use of the Korean language. In Korean language courses, all personal and social life, event, and processes are to be expressed in an adequate Korean way reflecting Korean culture and customs, and thus students always learn a new perspective that is different from their own cultural perspectives. It is often the case that students directly analyze some aspect of Korean culture and present/discuss/write about it using the information they gather and the viewpoint they have had.</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>WG-4:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>WG-5:</strong> Language is identity. Students will experience what is like to rely on a means of communication that is foreign at the onset. Through their own challenges in language acquisition they will become more sensitized to inter societal differences in the cultures, lifestyles, identities and beliefs between the Korean and their own societies. 
There are also intra societal differences such as gender roles, age and generation, implicit or explicit social classes, and the ways that these differences are encoded in the structure and usage of the Korean language. Students’ direct exposure to spoken and written forms in Korean produced by speakers and writers from diverse backgrounds allows them to appreciate these social differences.
Through lectures, interpretive activities, assignments, and their own researches, students are required to identify, analyze, and internalize by practice the role that the inter and intra societal differences play in the Korean languages.</p>
<p><strong>WG-6:</strong> During each class session, students speak, listen, read, and write in Korean to communicate with one another about Korean culture as well as their own cultures, often from comparative perspectives. The consistent use of Korean in and outside the classroom and exposure to Korean cultural productions (TV shows, cinema, journalism, literature) enable students to appreciate the relationship between language and culture in Korea and in Korean-speaking communities outside Korea.</p>

<h3 id="WCGIKOR306">KOR 306 Advanced Korean II [WG LANG]</h3><h4>Approved 2016-12-12</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Language is a complex system of multiple sub-systems such as phonetics, vocabulary, and grammar, which have their own governing rules. As a native speaker of at least one language, we all have certain knowledge, whether implicit or explicit, on the phonetics, vocabulary, and grammar systems of our language, and thus this knowledge is readily applicable to foreign languages we learn. Using their knowledge on language as a system of systems, students are encouraged to attempt to generalize sound patterns, morphological rules, and grammatical patterns based on the language input they are given from the audio/video/textual materials and instructors. They are also encouraged to identify exceptions and irregular forms to their generalizations and learn about how to effectively deal with them. In doing so, students are asked to compare the structural properties of Korean with those of their own language to better understand the distinctive characteristics of Korean sound, word, and sentence structures.
Language is also a tool for communication which reflects the social customs and cultural uniqueness. Students are taught to understand that language should be not just grammatically correct and meaningful but also socio-culturally adequate and natural. Therefore, students should always ask: What is the best translation? Is it the most accurate? The most complete? Or the one that is most natural and adequate? Students will find answers to these questions regarding communicative and cultural aspects of the Korean language by gathering information from the audio/video/textual course materials, learning from lectures/explanations by instructors, and participating in the conversational and presentational activities.
All Korean language courses also aims to equip students with a certain level of fluency. With practice, language becomes easier to use. In fact, ease of use in an increasing number of contexts is one way to characterize fluency. Therefore, students will constantly ask themselves about the effective ways of language learning: How do we improve our fluency? Learn more words? Become more culturally aware? Does practice make perfect? Students are required to do a variety of assignments and will learn by experience what are the best or most effective practices for them.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> In general, language is of central importance to all human interaction. Even the adaptation of the notion of “text” to films, music, etc extends the metaphor of language to non-verbal domains. Therefore, it should be a given that a course of instruction that is dedicated to raising awareness of such a central human activity has a place in a liberal arts curriculum.
In particular, Korean, as a foreign language, opens up the possibility for students to learn more about the Korean-speaking society, whether they are more into the language per se or other disciplines such as politics, history, pop-culture, literature, philosophy, business, or even science and engineering. Knowledge of Korean allows students to engage directly with cultural productions from the area(s) where the language is spoken and to understand them in their linguistic and social context. Also, knowledge of one or more foreign languages is a valuable asset for students considering graduate school or seeking employment in the international field. Therefore, it can be concluded that Korean is an essential part of the liberal arts curriculum.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Through in-class oral and written practice in the Portuguese language and discussion of the rules of Portuguese grammar, vocabulary, and phonetics, students will gain awareness of the cognitive processes involved in adult second-language acquisition. Written and oral exercises on exams will allow students to identify and articulate the advantages and challenges encountered by adult second language learners.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Knowledge of Portuguese or another language other than English is an essential part of the liberal arts curriculum in that it allows students to engage directly with cultural productions from the cultures of the Portuguese-speaking world and to understand them in their linguistic and social context. Written assignments and in-class activities require students to reflect on the place of the Portuguese language in the eight countries and three territories where it is spoken, in the U.S., and in the world.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students gather and interpret information from audio-visual and print sources for in-class oral presentations and activities. They work independently and with their instructor to interpret and assess information from a variety of sources in order to draft and edit written responses in Portuguese.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Students differentiate between standard Portuguese, formal and informal forms of address, socio-economic markers in vocabulary and syntax, and regional variants of Portuguese around the world. In class discussions and written assignments, students identify, interpret, and react to these varieties of language. Homework assignments and exam questions require students to evaluate evidence and arguments in written texts and to formulate an appropriate response.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students draft short essays in Portuguese where they use evidence drawn from advertising, journalism, and literature to support their ideas. For instance, students may be asked to read a newspaper article, write a reaction to a short story in Portuguese or work with their classmates to describe differences between American and Portuguese cultural practices using precise vocabulary and basic syntactic structures.</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> Students are asked to become conscious second language learners and reflect orally and in writing on their progress and challenges. Students complete written assignments requiring them to explain their interpretation of audio-visual materials and written texts in Portuguese. At the Portuguese 203 level, students use the Portuguese language to discuss current, past and possible future events, express and support their opinions, and speak and write about cultural tradition, the labor market, health related issues, and artistic and historical heritage. 

Student progress will be evaluated by using the American Council on Teaching of Foreign Languages proficiency guidelines. ACTFL guidelines distinguish between levels of proficiency in speaking, reading, writing, and listening. In addition to completing assignments that will allow the instructor to assess students’ proficiency, students are required to do periodic self-assessment assignments and report on their own progress.</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> Students’ direct exposure to documents and audio-visual materials in Portuguese produced by speakers and writers from diverse backgrounds allows them to appreciate the role played by the language in Africa, America, Asia and Europe. Exam questions require students to demonstrate proficiency in Portuguese. Readings and class discussions require students to demonstrate awareness of the global role of Portuguese in relation to that of English and other world languages. In-class activities in Portuguese sensitize students to structural and conceptual differences between Portuguese, English, and other languages other than English.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives SS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives SS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Comparative Politics requires students to collect country data in order to answer broad questions about political processes within states. The course therefore requires students to collect evidence from a variety of sources (for example quantitative measures about economic markets and political policies, qualitative descriptions of political cultural development, or analyses of institutional structures such as parliaments or executive power). Students are introduced to varying arguments regarding why states act and develop in particular ways and must then critically analyze those arguments.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Students are introduced to data sources and are required to use evidence to examine major arguments in comparative politics. For example, one assignment in a sample course asks for students to read a selected monograph on a post-colonial state and then use the data within that book, together with other course materials, to draw conclusions on major arguments on current politics in developing states. In order to do well on this assignment, students must use evidence to put forth an argument, anticipate counter arguments, and refute them.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students practice using data and theory to make written and/or oral arguments. This outcome draws on the skills developed in the first two points above. In the sample PSCI 103 course, students are given explicit instruction on argumentative writing, for example how to craft an effective thesis statement and how to structure paragraphs to support the building of a logical argument leading to a conclusion. Students are given opportunity to practice this craft and given constructive feedback in order to improve their writing and argumentative skills.</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> Comparative Politics, as a subfield of political science, investigates the political structures of states. The discipline engages big questions in political science (”What causes democracy?”, “What is the effect of communist economic systems on political regime?”, “What are the political effects of oil economies”, “How have mechanisms of development effected political development over time?”, “What are the causes of civil wars?”) and investigates the domestic politics of any country in the world. As such, it takes up critical questions involved in world cultures (for example, political economic systems, modes of development, cultural diversity, political institutional development) at their very core. The nature of the subfield itself is also interdisciplinary, since any comprehensive understanding of a states’ political development must take up issues of history, economy, sociology, geography, and anthropology.</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> In examining country cases, students investigate political cultures, the impact of Western political and economic schemes (often considered as “globalization”), political history in order to analyze current politics and predict future outcomes. This analysis and prediction draws from differing theoretical literatures which place importance on different variables.</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> Few comparative politics courses examine the U.S. closely, instead focusing on other states that are emblematic of the key questions in political science. In but one example, the class examines the historical development of the United Kingdom, Japan, Nigeria and China.</p>
<p><strong>WG-4:</strong> PSCI 103 Comparative Politics examines the role that imperialism and colonialism has had on the countries of Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America. Courses often examine the impact of the Western revolutions in France and the United Kingdom in bringing about the Western development into democratic capitalism. They consider the Marxist critique of capitalism and the development of communist movements in the East, for example, in Russia, China, and Cuba.</p>
<p><strong>WG-5:</strong> Given the role that cultural diversity has on politics within society, courses in comparative politics must address this scholarly arena. Comparative politics courses often take up questions of ethnic conflict, how class affects political development and institutions, and how states interact with religious diversity.</p>
<p><strong>WG-6:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>NOTE-1:</strong> This course is not specifically required for any major, but it fulfills the 100 level requirement for political science, as well as any major that requires a 100 level social science elective.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> The required readings for the course provide are by numerous authors representing viewpoints. These readings include surveys of political science research, monographs, memoirs, policy advocacy, and journalistic accounts. Students will also engage additional readings found through their own research. Class lectures highlight competing theoretical perspectives such as realism, liberalism, and constructivism. Students will interpret these readings in class discussion and in papers.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Class lecture and discussion will model critical and analytical thinking by working through competing arguments, evaluating the logic and evidence on which they are based, and identifying their strengths and weaknesses. Students develop critical thinking skills further by engaging in class discussion and by writing analytical papers.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students will write in-class essays and/or take-home papers requiring the analysis and presentation of deductive and evidence-based arguments. The course will review the basic requirements of good expository writing, which students will be required to implement in their papers.</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> This course exposes students to fundamental debates over the utility of force, threats, and positive inducements in international politics, as well as over the roles of international law and organization, globalization, ideas, domestic politics, and the distribution of power.  It will introduce students to what political scientists have learned about international politics, including the struggle and cooperation of nations and non-state actors over power, security, wealth, and other goals.</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> This course analyzes the nature of globalization, its causes, and its consequences for international politics. Students will engage multiple perspectives on these questions in course readings and lectures. Case studies on particular topics like global textile and apparel trade and climate change will also expose students to the impact of these processes on the prosperity and well-being of different societies and social groups, sometimes from the point of view of affected individuals and policymakers.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Through in-class oral and written practice in the Spanish language and discussion of the rules of Spanish grammar, vocabulary, and phonetics, students will gain awareness of the cognitive processes involved in adult second-language acquisition. Written and oral exercises on exams will allow students to identify and articulate the advantages and challenges encountered by adult second language learners.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Spanish is increasingly important in the interdependent global community of the twenty-first century. Knowledge of Spanish or another language other than English is an essential part of the liberal arts curriculum in that it allows students to engage directly with cultural productions from Hispanic cultures and to understand them in their linguistic and social context. Written assignments require students to reflect on the place of the Spanish language in the countries where this language is spoken, in the U.S., and in the world. Also, knowledge of one or more foreign languages is a valuable asset for students considering graduate school or seeking employment in the international field. Spanish is particularly useful for students who are pursuing careers in education, medicine, social work, and law.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students gather and interpret information from audio-visual and print sources for in-class oral and written activities. Written sources and audio-visual materials strengthen students’ understanding of the literature, history, customs and culture of the peoples who are using this language. Students work independently or with their instructor to interpret and assess information from a variety of sources in order to draft and edit essays in Spanish.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Students differentiate between standard Spanish, formal and informal forms of address, socio-economic markers in vocabulary and syntax, and regional variants of Spanish. In class discussions and written assignments, students identify, interpret, and react to these varieties of language. Homework assignments and exam questions require students to evaluate evidence and arguments in written texts and to formulate an appropriate response.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students draft essays in Spanish where they use evidence drawn from cinema, journalism, and literature to support an argument. For instance, students may be asked to write a detailed review of a Spanish-language film or work with their classmates to defend an opinion using precise vocabulary and varied syntactic structures.</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> Students are asked to become conscious second language learners and reflect orally and in writing on their progress and challenges. The only requirement is not only proficiency in Spanish, but also approaching a language that has a varied and recognized literature and culture.  At the Spanish 204 level, students review thoroughly the main points of grammar pertinent to the indicative, subjunctive, potential and imperative moods while reviewing and learning vocabulary related to professions, banking, the environment, social issues, and current events in Spanish. Student progress will be evaluated by using the American Council on Teaching of Foreign Languages proficiency guidelines. ACTFL guidelines distinguish between levels of proficiency in speaking, reading, writing, and listening. In addition to completing assignments that will allow the instructor to assess students’ proficiency, students are required to do periodic self-assessment assignments and report on their own progress.</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> By learning not just literature and grammar, but also history, arts, literatures, and customs of different Hispanic countries, students are thought to develop a more expansive view of the diverse Hispanic world and be more intellectually and culturally capable.</p>

<h3 id="WCGIURBST326">URBST 326 Cities and Diasporas [WG]</h3><h4>Approved 2015-03-16</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> This course draws from multiple areas of study such as history, sociology, political science, health and gender studies that not only contribute to the interdisciplinary fields of urban studies and migration studies but also are situated within the broad landscape of the social sciences. It is this from these multidisciplinary perspectives that students are able to compare how scientific knowledge about cities and diasporas is produced. Required readings and class lectures, culled from multiple sources, reflect various viewpoints and address questions such as Where is home? Need it be in one place? Is it always attached to territory? What is the relationship between place and belonging, between territory and memory? What are the effects of new modes of communication on the coherence of cultural and political boundaries? Students provide critically thought out answers to these questions through experiential learning and the exposure it provides to a chosen diasporic group. Student answers also result from the dual foci of the course: history and classifications of diasporas and theoretical methods employed in the study of diasporas from various times and places, and the application of specific theories and methods to the analysis and explanations of contemporary diasporic group within the urban context of New York City. Students are taught basic urban research skills and methods such as historical analysis, census data analysis, survey research and observation through fieldwork. Students learn to critically analyze the underlying pressures and power of different diasporas.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> The various themes addressed in this course: of displacement, migration, resettlement, of moving or being moved, and about transnational living contain a deep level of resonance for our immensely diverse student body and character of our college. The continuing rise of diasporic communities worldwide, consisting of both immigrants and refugees creates a critical need for this course within the Queen’s College general education curriculum. Its contribution to the liberal arts curriculum at our college lies in its emphasis on the historical and contemporary importance and contributions of different population groups that comprise many of the older and more recent diasporas in the US, NYC as a gateway, and Queens County with its broad diversity and concentrations of multiple diasporas. The course also explores some of the controversies that surround distinct diasporic groups around the world and examines the connections between urban politics, the urban economy and group politics. Critical engagement with the meaning and organization of diasporas through weekly lectures that highlight key concepts and ideas such diasporic identity, maintenance of boundaries, and relations to a real or imagined homeland, transnationality, citizenship, remittances, multiculturalism,and host society integration help students understand the methods used by different scholars to explain these concepts. Students are exposed to a range of experiences, viewpoints and theories which is helpful as they are often seeking to understand their own diasporic experience and that of their family and close friends that form part of the community they now inhabit in their host country.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> This course examines the history and meaning of Diaspora and exposes students to fundamental issues and debates about the diversity, scope and functioning of diasporas in the global urban environment. It uses the city-scape of NYC and Queens County as a laboratory in which to closely observe selected diasporic communities and the extent to which they can be classified according to different theories and typologies as constituting or exhibiting characteristics of one distinct form of diaspora or another. The required reading material exposes students to diasporas from multiple points of view, historical time periods and the perspectives of different groups. Students are also taught data gathering techniques based on urban research methods such as community level census data analysis, survey research, historical analysis and fieldwork observations. Students compare, assess and interpret evidence and arguments from a variety of sources that include scholarly articles, the national and international sections of the NY TImes, selected media tools, book chapters, community observations, blogs, community specific art and art projects. Through in-class lectures, assignments and presentations, students assess, interpret and compare scholarly and cultural debates, popular media views and interpretations, by providing the theoretical and political basis on which Diaspora groups maintain group coherence, internal and external group power and different levels of integration in urban contexts.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Critical engagement with the meaning, history, and organization of Diaspora are the cornerstone of this course. Weekly lectures highlight the key issues of moving or being moved across borders whether of near or far distance, of being integrated or maintaining group boundaries, or maintaining communication, or involvement with or a sense of responsibility to: “home,” as well as the intricacies of transnationalism and cosmopolitanism. Students are then helped to understand histories of pre-modern diasporas and the interconnections of contemporary diasporas to urban life and the differences influenced by race, gender, class and country of origin. All reading assignments, midterm exams and final essays and exams are designed to reinforce critical thinking about distinctions among diaspora groups that is evident in readings and modeled in class lectures. For example students read about the recurring controversies such as those that surround the failure of Latino Diasporas to achieve middle class attainment by the second generation, or health scares around the prevalence of Hepatitus C or HIV/AIDSs in select population groups as opposed to the native born population or the disappearance of work due to large Mexican Diaspora in many urban areas of the US or the economic drain of North African Refugees in Italy or Syrian refugees in Turkey and other countries. Students also examine the merits of different paradigms related to group integration, “model minority” status, workforce performance and learn about debates and political tensions between some diaspora groups and the host societies. Students read articles based on different kinds of social science research from surveys, qualitative and quantitative studies, geographic and spatial analyses, historical and census studies. They learn to compare findings from different kinds of scholarly work, to assess the effectiveness of various research methods and to determine the limitations of studies,</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> In-class writing assignments, homework, essays and exams specifically help students to sharpen writing skills, critical thinking skills in making oral arguments around the key issues related to Cities and Diasporas. Assignments typically require students to utilize information, debates and arguments presented during lectures and in required reading materials. For example students are required to write an essay explaining the integration or non-integration of Blacks in Latin America from the perspective of the extensive exclusionary practices operating in Latin America or the deliberate efforts of some Black Groups such as the Garifuna population to maintain group boundaries. The final essay requires them to provide well reasoned evidence of the Diaspora status of distinct NYC groups which students will base Diaspora theories, typologies,  group organization and functioning, their level of participation in transnational living, levels of integration, as well as analyses of theories of inclusion. Students will also use their final essays to do oral presentations in which they cull the most salient points of their essay arguments to create a power presentation delivered to the entire class.</p>
<p><strong>WG-1:</strong> The essence of this course consists of the key concepts, methods and evidence that concerns the multi-disciplinary fields of Urban Studies and Migration Studies. In the first weeks of the course students are introduced to the fields: they learn that urban studies emerged in the 1960s to bring together scholars and practitioners from many disciplines in order to create innovative, real-world knowledge of the challenges and opportunities in city-life. In subsequent weeks, lectures highlight the ways that interdisciplinary approaches help scholars to gain a particular vantage point on the sources and meaning of diaspora, diversity and politics in world in which the majority of the global population is urbanized. For example, in a lecture on different classifications of Diaspora groups and their integration into host societies, students compare the work of a historian, economist and cultural analyst on the importance and contributions of Diaspora groups to both their home country and their current adopted country. Each of these readings brought a unique disciplinary or interdisciplinary perspective to questions about the meaning of Diaspora in the global urban arena.</p>
<p><strong>WG-2:</strong> This course takes culture, globalization and global cultural diversity as the lens through which to explore the broader themes of migration, culture, identity, multiculturalism, diversity, freedom, democracy, and inclusion.  It focuses in particular on the struggles of both some new immigrants and some long lasting Diasporas, and indeed all subordinated groups for inclusion and recognition. The course emphasizes scholarly debates over the meaning of culture, diversity, maintenance of group identity, transnationalism and cosmopolitanism. Different sections of the course introduces students to the global history of Diasporas and the more recent movement of populations groups especially low income, low literacy women.  For example, Latinos, clearly a labor Diaspora are projected to achieve majority status in the US in another 15-20 years.  Students learn to analyze this event from multiple perspectives: politically - what are the implications of a majority Latino voter base for our two major political parties system; economically the concern is with the earning power over time, of low income, low education workers to sustain beneficial programs such as Social Security.  Culturally, the debate and much of the fear has to do with the question of which culture prevails when a non-white group achieves majority status.  Students also learn about contemporary controversies regarding group cultural identity, community belonging, political power and economic inequality and the extent to which all these multiple points of view about a specific cultural group are all influenced by issues of race, gender, class and culture.  The course ends with scholarly debates over global cultural diversity, multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism.</p>
<p><strong>WG-3:</strong> In weeks IV and V the course focuses on Pre Modern Diasporas.  Students learn about the evolution of Europe from fragmented feudalism to development of coastal cities where merchants from Africa, Asia and India, members of a fully functioning world economic system since the 9th Century sold silks, spices and fine goods.  Students use class assignments, readings, and discussions as sources to conduct analyses of the results of Europe’s efforts to join this economic system.  For example students examine the results of the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade (TST) namely the historical development of not only Europe and the US but also the multiple Latin American and Caribbean, non-US societies of the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p><strong>WG-4:</strong> Weeks IX, X and XI are devoted to exploration of Multicultural societies and the inter-relationships between the Diaspora groups that inhabit them. Students use class readings and assignments to analyze the significance of the two major movements that shaped world societies: colonialism and post-colonialism.  For example readings from Kundnani and Joppke helped provide focus on efforts of liberal societies (England, Australia and the US) to use  multiculturalism to control their post-colonial Diaspora groups while Prashad’s work provides evidence of Afro-Asian connections that helped to foster abolition and liberation movements throughout the Caribbean and Latin America. Also discussed are the Liberation and Human RIghts movements led by Ghandi in INdia and MLKing in the US that ultimately turned the tide of world sympathy toward Indians and Blacks.</p>
<p><strong>WG-5:</strong> Race, ethnicity, class, gender, language, sexual orientation, belief and other forms of social differentiation are essential topics for this course because their role in determining how Diaspora groups relate to the host societies.  The central questions of the course are: How do  Diaspora groups differ from one another?; How do they contribute to the diversity and operation of Cities? and, How do Cities manage, integrate or exclude the different Diasporas in their midst.  Considerable time is given to insistence that Diasporas cannot be understood exclusively on their own terms but must in fact also be considered in relation to other groups, institutions, and patterns of urban life and that is influenced as well by the individual effects and the intersection of race, ethnicity, class, gender, language and other factors.</p>
<p><strong>WG-6:</strong> The overwhelming majority of students at QC who are immigrants or children of immigrants tend to speak, read and write a language other than English.  Some of them, especially those who are more recent immigrant arrivals are still struggling with use of the English language.  That is not the case with most native born students who tend most often to be monolingual English speakers and who are encouraged to learn another language that they can use to interact with and respond to, cultures other than their own.</p>

<h3 id="CEARTH1">ARTH 1 Introduction to Art [CE]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-04-16</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> “Art 1” has long been the most basic introductory course to the visual arts at QC, even before the LASAR system recognized it as a component of the general-education core.   By the nature of the topic, covering a long timespan and so many civilizations — not to mention the conflicts, exchanges, influences, and legacies between those civilizations — it has always been taught, almost unavoidably, as a series of case studies in comparative cultural history. The multiple and constantly changing methods and assumptions behind the ongoing acquisition of art-historical knowledge are highlighted in different ways for each period: from the role of archeology in classical art studies to the influence of the scientific method on 17th- and 18th-century European art. Because a main goal of the course is to introduce the field as a whole, it inevitably focuses on making explicit the major questions that art historians ask (when, where, who, why, etc.), thereby giving students a matrix of basic goals and methods of the field that can then be applied to more specific cultures.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Works of art are  an integral part of the society that produces and views them, and thus provide ample opportunity to discuss how the examination of art can profit from aspects of other disciplines such as area studies, history, philosophy, anthropology, comparative literature. Class lectures and readings introduce various methods of the discipline, and explore how each of these is at the intersection of art history and other fields of inquiry (historical, sociological, economic, philosophical/religious, etc.).
    The course is ideologically aligned with the liberal arts curriculum in bringing a global and comparative perspective to the study of world cultures, ranging from ancient societies to those thriving in our own neighborhoods.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> In order to understand the stylistic, historical, and social contexts of visual art, students will be introduced to relevant portions of each culture/period’s literature, history, religions, and political ideologies. Assessment activities (exams and assignments) ask the students to synthesize information from four sources: 1) classroom lectures; 2) course textbook; 3) regular reading of scholarly articles and book chapters, and 4)primary materials, both literary/historical and the art objects themselves, which are the primary materials of this discipline.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> In-class discussion of assigned readings prompts students to identify the themes and issues of each reading, and to critique each author in terms of whether the arguments made are coherent, comprehensible, convincing, and valuable.  Students are then assigned a written critique of one course reading, in which they are prompted to do the same in more detail. These discussions and exercises are preparatory to the exams, which require written essays on similar topics drawn from course readings.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> One half of the final exam asks students to produce analytical essays on topics covered in the class readings. Some ask for a critique of a single essay, others ask for comparison of diferent points of view or methods.
Two short papers ask students to describe and analyze architectural spaces and 2-dimensional artworks, and the support a thesis about them with observations drawn from the objects themselves.</p>
<p><strong>CE-1:</strong> Course lectures present key methodologies used in the discipline of art history, and many readings embody specific methods. Students learn the necessary cultural, art and architectural terminology to translate visual objects into written and oral descriptions which are fundamental to visual analysis. Assignments and tests ask the students to apply such methodologies to specific artworks: to identify styles, materials and technologies, and patterns of both meaning (artists’ intentions) and reception (audience response to images).</p>
<p><strong>CE-2:</strong> Because this course covers millennia of artistic evolution, it continually problematizes how one generation builds on, alters, or rejects the traditions it has inherited. Examples of this central theme range from Renaissance artists being inspired to revive forms and techniques from the classical past to Chinese painters’ sense of continually modifying yet endlessly reurning to the revered art of past dynasties.  With the rise of Romanticism in the later 18th century, students are introduced to the concept  of “eclecticism,” a cultural philosophy based on “raiding” a wide variety of past cultures for forms whose historical asssociations embodied various ambitions of the present.  From the 19th century to the present, a contrasting dynamic is central: the development of the “avant-garde” and the valuing of deliberate innovation and of ruptures with tradition.  Such concepts are addressed in many of the course readings, including primary sources that propagandize for one pole or the other of this range of attitudes.</p>

<p><strong>CE-4:</strong> Visual art is framed in this course as an aspect of material culture, and lectures emphasize the actual media and processes of art-making as fundamental to understanding the possibilities for creative expression afforded by each medium, and the search for more expressive and adaptable techniques and materials. We discuss, e.g., the desire to revive media and processes that were known in one period but lost in another, and the transmission of new techniques from one area to another.  The required museum visit provides an opportunity for students to examine the physical composition of artworks first-hand (medium, brushstroke, color), and to demonstrate their ability to describe process and product in words. All slide-exam questions ask the students to identify the materials and technologies of art and architecture and discuss their significance in the broader cultural context.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> The course primarily employs a socio-historical method:  The work of art is interpreted contextually, with emphasis on its production and function, and these methods are made explicit throughout lectures and dicussion, as well as in choice of readings, which raise questions about how a field of inquiry is constituted. (How did the artist come to create the work? Who were its patrons and sponsors? Its original audience, and what did it mean to them? What historical forces shaped the work and in turn how does the work mirror/reflect its social, political, religious and artistic context?) Comparison of reading assignments, and a written critique, develop critical awareness about the nature of sources and a sensitivity to scholarly “agendas.”</p>

<p><strong>CE-2:</strong> Because this course covers more than 600 years of artistic evolution, it continually problematizes how one generation builds on, alters, or rejects the traditions it has inherited.  In the earlier part of the course, a central theme is how Renaissance artists were inspired to revive forms and techniques from the classical past.  With the rise of Neoclassicism and Romanticism in the later 18th century, students are introduced to the concept of of “eclecticism,” a cultural philosophy that was based on “raiding” a wide variety of past cultures for forms whose historical asssociations embodied various ambitions of the present.  From the early 19th century to the present, a contrasting dynamic is central: the development of the “avant-garde” and the valuing of deliberate innovation and ruptures with tradition.  Such concepts are addressed in many of the course readings, including primary sources that propagandize for one pole or the other of this range of attitudes.</p>
<p><strong>CE-3:</strong> The notion of “meaning” is central to the visual arts, which aim to communicate ideas, beliefs, or ideologies through an emotionally powerful medium.  Within each period and each artwork, the presentation emphasizes the goals of the traditional patron and the artist, who together establish what the work is aiming to convey and how to do so.  For modern and contemporary works produced by an independent artist for an open market, the “patron” is more diffuse, but discussion of such works still includes consideration of the artist’s intent, as well as an examination of the worlds of art galleries, msueums, written criticsm, and oother elements of artistic discourse that create multiple meanings through interpretation, methods of display, and modern marketing and communications.</p>
<p><strong>CE-4:</strong> Visual art is framed in this course as an aspect of material culture, and lectures emphasize the actual media and processes of art-making as fundamental to understanding the possibilities for creative expression afforded by each medium, and the search for more expressive and adaptable techniques and materials. We also discuss the desire to revive media and processes that were known in antiquity but lost during the Middle Ages (concrete, bronze casting), and the transmission of new techniques such as oil paint from one area to another.  The required museum visit provides an opportunity for students to examine the physical composition of artworks first-hand (medium, brushstroke, color).

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives AP Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives AP Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> No single source exists to explain the environment that created ancient art or the environment ancient art influenced.  Therefore students must engage both the artwork itself and the broader liberal arts to learn the salient historical and social contexts of ancient art. Students will come to know relevant portions of ancient literatures, histories, religions and political ideologies. In turn, assessment activities (exams and assignments) ask the students synthesize information from four sources: 1) classroom lectures; 2) course textbook; 3) the Oxford History of Art; and 4) regular reading of scholarly articles.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> A survey of ancient art is broad and covers a vast range of geography, chronology and human activity. Periodically, the students will read scholarly articles which introduce pockets of depth and focus on particular monuments, specific media, or individual subject matters. One assessment activity (Scholarly Article Critique) asks the students to read two peer-reviewed scholarly articles and prepare an essay (about 800 - 1000 words in length) that identifies and outlines the author’s scope and method(s) of analysis.  The goal is to help students develop critical reading and interpretive skills.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> For one part of each exam, the students prepare two analytical and argumentative essays on the stylistic identification of an unknown piece of art or building. Students will be presented with an artwork or building that they have not previously seen or studied and asked to place it in its proper art historical context.  The goal of the essay is to develop a command of visual analysis, hone the student’s ability to see and translate art and architecture into descriptive text, and to build arguments based on the comparative analyses of other known works of art or buildings.</p>
<p><strong>CE-1:</strong> The media, or primary sources and documents of initial inquiry are the very products of creative expression themselves: painting, sculpture, and architecture from Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Ancient Near East, the Bronze Age Aegean, Ancient Greece, Ancient Tuscany (the Etruscans) and Ancient Rome.  Although these products were meant for visual consumption, the students learn the necessary cultural, art and architectural terminology to translate visual objects into written and oral descriptions which are fundamental to visual analysis. Course lectures present key methodologies used in the discipline of art history, for example, formal and contextual analyses. Assignments ask the students to apply such methodologies to identify styles, materials and technologies, and artistic conventions.</p>
<p><strong>CE-2:</strong> While examining ancient art, students will apply the same methods of critical inquiry to the art and architecture of their everyday world. Many cultural aspects of the ancient Mediterranean civilizations provided the foundations for western society and thought, and much of this legacy is still visually present today.  With a series of brief case studies, the students will compare an ancient art form and its social context with a contemporary example in order to raise questions about the world around them.</p>
<p><strong>CE-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>CE-4:</strong> One quarter of classroom discussions and lectures is allotted to the making of art and architecture. The resources devoted to an object’s production or a building in antiquity were enormous.  Understanding the needs and desires underlying these expenditures is necessary to understanding the use of art and architecture in ancient cultures. Assessment activities (assignments and exams) ask the students to identify the materials and technologies of art and architecture and discuss their significance in the broader cultural context.</p>

<h3 id="CEARTH113">ARTH 113 Survey of Modern Art [CE]</h3><h4>Approved 2015-05-11</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> The method for this course is primarily what art historians call the “social history of art” in the sense that its focus is on asking and answering questions about the larger social, historical and political framework in which artworks are created - in effect, the ways that artworks both reflect, and reflect on, their larger institutional contexts, which they reciprocally define. In addition, this course aims to introduce students, early in their studies of the arts and humanities, to the broader spectrum of fundamental methods that art historians (as well as those in allied disciplines) have used - both traditionally and, with respect to more contemporary methods like cultural studies, since the 1970s - to assess and evaluate the significance of artworks in relation to the societies that have produced them.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> In the increasingly media-saturated society in which we live, the ability of students meaningfully to grapple with visual images and other kinds of visual evidence not as transparent documents of some pre-given historical truth but, rather, as constitutive of the very category that we understand as historical truth - as ideological, in other words - is vital. Classroom lectures and assigned readings will introduce students to the fundamental methods of the discipline, and explore how they exist at the intersection of art history and related disciplines, including formalist methods (in the case, for example, of Abstract Expressionism), psychoanalytic and semiotic methods (in the case, for example, of Surrealism), as well the rise of cultural studies and the increasing interplay between the visual arts and identity politics since the 1970s. In particular, much classroom discussion and many of the assigned readings will focus on questions of gender and sexual orientation, ethnicity and race, and their intrinsic relationship to the production and reception of artworks in the modern period. Just as importantly, in many ways this course lays the groundwork for how we - as a society - understand modernity, including the impact of Enlightenment ideals on the American and French Revolutions; the rise of industrialization and urbanization in the nineteenth century; and the roles both of mass production since the early twentieth century, and of the mass media since the mid-twentieth century.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> In order to understand the larger social, historical and political framework in which artworks are created, students will be introduced to relevant readings that reflect the history and politics, art, literature and music, as well as political and other philosophies characteristic of the periods we will study. Assessment activities, which will include two in-class exams and one research paper, will ask students to synthesize information from five principal sources: (1) classroom lectures and discussions; (2) museum and / or gallery lectures and discussions, which will vary depending on the exhibitions on view when the course is taught; (3) primary source materials, which include the artworks themselves, most notably, as well as interviews, statements and writings by the artists who created them, along with corollary examples of art, literature and music from the periods we will study; (4) the course textbooks, which include an excellent survey of late 18th and 19th Century art, along with one or more anthologies of artists’ writings in the first and second halves of the 20th Century; and (5) additional assigned readings, including scholarly articles and book chapters, which are intended to complement and flesh out specific areas of focus in classroom discussions and the course textbooks.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> The two in-class exams, along with the one research paper, will require students critically to evaluate significant artworks, in particular, ones that we have comprehensively focused on, and discussed in depth, whether in the classroom or in museums and / or galleries. One half of the midterm and final exams will test students’ familiarity with primary data concerning the artworks themselves; building on and complementing this essential information, the other half will ask students to produce analytical and interpretive essays on artworks that we have extensively covered in lectures and discussions, as well as in the course textbooks and additional assigned readings. In turn, the research paper will require students to gather evidence from the paramount, primary source material in art history, actual artworks in local museums and / or galleries, which we will visit, in order to produce a comparative visual analysis and interpretation in which their arguments are supported not only by close readings of the visual evidence but also by outside research on the artists who created these artworks, including their larger social, historical and political framework.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> The class will include a significant component of classroom discussion intended to develop the ability of students to assess and evaluate the historical significance of artworks, in relation to the individual artists - and corollary institutional frameworks - that produced them. In addition, the research paper will require students critically to evaluate a pair of artworks not merely through first-hand observation of the artworks themselves but, moreover, by researching their social, historical and political context and scope of influence and, perhaps most importantly of all, by thinking about them synthetically in relation to one another, with respect to important features they do (or, significantly, do not) share. Indeed, the ultimate goal of this research paper, in many ways, is less art historical per se than developing the necessary - analytic, critical and interpretive - tools that separate conjecture from informed opinion in any field in the arts and humanities, a process that will also be elaborated through classroom discussion of research methods and scholarly apparatus.</p>
<p><strong>CE-1:</strong> As discussed above, although the primary method for this course will draw on the “social history of art,” it will also introduce students to the diverse methods of analysis and interpretation characteristic of art history and allied disciplines, including formalist methods, psychoanalytic and semiotic methods, as well the rise of cultural studies and the increasing interplay of the visual arts - not only their production but also their reception - with identity politics since the 1970s.</p>
<p><strong>CE-2:</strong> This course will primarily draw on major artworks from Europe since the late 18th Century, from Russia and Mexico in the early 20th Century, and from the US since the mid-20th Century. However, it will also include a substantial component on the influence of Japanese art on the rise of European Modernism, as well as the ideological construction of myriad peoples from North Africa, the Middle East and Turkey in so-called Orientalist art, in France most notably. Overall, the social-historical focus of this course is intended to serve as a guidepost for students, which they can bring to bear on contemporary artistic practices, in order to appreciate how they also function as a mirror of the larger socio-political realities that they - often, more overtly - not only reflect but also define and shape.</p>
<p><strong>CE-3:</strong> In addition to the essential methods of art history, this course will also introduce students to the discipline-specific language and tools of art history, regardless of the historical period in question, by encouraging students to develop an understanding of the types of subject matter that artworks variously represent, including the historical concept of the “hierarchy of genres” that Modernism did so much to overthrow; the iconography or symbolism that artworks often incorporate; the fundamental differences between representational and abstract or nonobjective art, especially as we move into the 19th and 20th Centuries; and, finally, the basic vocabulary - the “formal” vocabulary - that art historians use to analyze an artwork’s form and color, its system of spatial organization and, overall, its fundamental elements of composition and design.</p>

<h3 id="CEARTH114">ARTH 114 Survey of Asian Art [CE]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-04-16</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> The course primarily employs a socio-historical method in formulating a field of inquiry, which is made explicit to students in readings and lectures. The work of art is interrogated contextually, with emphasis on its production and function. (How did the artist come to create the work? Who were its patrons and sponsors? Its original audience, and what did it mean to them? What historical forces shaped the work and in turn how does the work both reflect and help create its social, political, religious and artistic context?</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> The socio-historical, or contextual, method of interpreting art is richly multi-disciplinary. It intersects with disciplines such as various area studies, History, Philosophy, Anthropology, Comparative Literature, etc. The course is ideologically aligned with the Liberal Arts curriculum in bringing a global and comparative perspective to the study of world cultures, ranging from ancient societies to those thriving in our own neighborhoods.  Class discussion focuses on making students aware of these connections across fields of inquiry, and also on demonstrating how the goals and methods of art history share common assumptions and practices with intersecting disciplines.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> A survey of Asian art is historically and geographically vast and varied, and diverse cultural, religious, philosophical and political currents (Hinduism, Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism, to name only a few) provide the context for understanding its art. Students are required to synthesize information from a great variety of sources and points of view: the objects of art themselves as primary sources (both in reproduction and in museum viewing); class lectures; course textbook; primary source excerpts; additional readings of scholarly articles; audio-visual resources. Essay-format questions on the 3 exams require students to bring all these sources to bear on the course’s primary focus — the art object — in short synthesizing essays, often involving two images at once.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> In this course, students are made aware of the set of cultural assumptions that we ourselves bring to viewing art. The course serves as a useful model for understanding differences between our own and other societies, both past and present. Diverse critical perspectives are introduced in lectures and a wide variety of readings. For example, the Victorian reaction to Hindu temple sculpture prompts the key classroom discussion of Colonialism and the ideology of Orientalism. Critical and analytical thinking is thus encouraged in the classroom. Essay sections of three exams require students to synthesize various perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students are provided with the methods and terminology to discuss and write about art analytically, using visual evidence (the art work itself) combined with contextual evidence (lectures, readings). Students are encouraged to develop these abilities in classroom discussion, and required to use this method of combined visual and contextual evidence in the essay parts of three exams and in  the major course paper, a comparative analysis of two museum objects.</p>
<p><strong>CE-1:</strong> Class lectures introduce various methods of the discipline (formal and contextual, as mentioned above), and certain readings are selected for their methodological approach. Students are introduced to the specialized terminology of the field and provided with weekly lists of terms and a glossary.   (Terminology, pronunciation and transcription can be particularly problematic in this course as many terms are Sanskrit, Chinese, Korean or Japanese.) Students learn to apply the appropriate methods and terminology in classroom discussion and in essay form.</p>
<p><strong>CE-2:</strong> The art and architecture of the diverse cultures of Asia has left a rich legacy worldwide. The final section of the course is devoted to modern art and architecture and its continuity with the past. Students develop the ability to analyze how the art of the past served as a foundation for the present. For example, modern architect Tadeo Ando draws on both ancient Shinto shrine traditions of rustic natural materials and Zen meditation gardens to create relief from Tokyo’s dense urban environment and to articulate issues of global sustainability. Students also develop the ability to analyze the connections and influences between Asian art of the past and the West as well: for example, the influence of Japanese woodcuts on early modern painting in France, or the impact of medieval Japanese architecture on the Bauhaus and Frank Lloyd Wright.</p>
<p><strong>CE-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>CE-4:</strong> An important component of this course is introducing students to a broad range of materials, techniques and formats often considered “Asian,” in that they are unique and/or indigenous to the regions (lacquer, jade, porcelain, silk, bamboo, piece-mold bronze casting, calligraphy, scrolls and screens). These objects and artifacts are studied as material culture, in that they convey social, spiritual and political meaning (e.g., the dead are buried with objects carved of jade, associated with immortality because of its hardness and durability).  Other materials and techniques play key roles in the broader historical context:  Chinese silk production, kept secret for almost 3,000 years, was as valuable a commodity as gold along the caravan routes to the West. Along the Silk Roads too came ideas, such as the momentous transmission of Buddhism to China from India. In exams, students are required to identify materials and techniques of art and architecture and to discuss their significance as material culture.</p>

<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Previously approved for the Perspectives AP Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> In order to understand the stylistic, historical, and social contexts of visual art, students will be introduced to relevant portions of early modern (1300-1750) literature, history, religions, and political ideologies. Assessment activities (exams and assignments) ask the students to synthesize information from four sources: 1) classroom lectures; 2) course textbook; 3) regular reading of scholarly articles, book chapters, and primary materials; 4) a range of material on a specific artwork, for a class group presentation (Final small-group project).</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> In-class discussion of each assigned reading prompts students to identify the themes and issues of each reading, and to critique each author in terms of whether the arguments made are coheent, comprehensible, convincing, and valuable.  These discussions are preparatory to the exams, which require written essays on similar topics.

Students are assigned a final group project in which they are asked to investigate the available information about a single work of art and to evaluate and synthesize their findings into a class report with illustrations.  The project is presented as an opportunity to help fellow students understand the issues and themes of specific works as a way to prepare for the kinds of short, object-based essays required on the final.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> One half of the midterm and final exams ask the students to produce analytical  essays on topics covered in the class readings. Some ask for a critique of a single essay, others ask for comparison of diferent points of view or methods.

The museum term paper requires students to gather evidence from one of the primary sources of this discipline, i.e., two art works at the Metropolitan Museum, and to produce a comparative visual analysis and interpretation in which their points are supported by direct visual evidence or outside research on the objects and artists.</p>
<p><strong>CE-1:</strong> Course lectures present key methodologies used in the discipline of art history, and many readings explicitly address specific methods (i.e., Panofsky on iconography, Barnet on an overview of various methods). Students learn the necessary cultural, art and architectural terminology to translate visual objects into written and oral descriptions which are fundamental to visual analysis. Assignments ask the students to apply such methodologies to specific artworks: to identify styles, materials and technologies, and patterns of both meaning (artists’ intentions) and reception (audience response to images).</p>
<p><strong>CE-2:</strong> The title/theme of this course is those aspects of Renaissance/early modern culture that are embryonic of the modern world, such as empiricism, science, globalization of culture, and technology.  Emphasis in lectures and readings is on continuities beween past and present, balanced by an introduction explaining that these are only selected aspects of the culture.  We examine the ways in which this ’classic” period  provided foundations for today’s art and culture, and how this legacy is still visually present. Students are given up to 3 class-participation points for bringing to class “show-and-tell” examples of contemporary visual culture that copy, adapt, or satirize familiar Renaissance prototypes; they usually become very enthusiastic about hunting down such parallels.</p>
<p><strong>CE-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>CE-4:</strong> Visual art is framed in this course as an aspect of material culture, and lectures emphasize the actual media and processes of art-making as fundamental to understanding the possibilities for creative expression afforded by each medium, and the search throughout the period for more expressive and adaptable techniques and materials. We also discuss the desire to revive media and processes that were known in antiquity but lost during the Middle Ages (concrete, bronze casting), and the transmission of new techniques such as oil paint from one area to another.  The required museum visit provides an opportunity for students to examine the physical composition of artworks first-hand (medium, brushstroke, color).

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Over the course of the term, students are required to synthesize information from multiple sources: 1) classroom lectures, which introduce a range of scholarly and critical perspectives on Contemporary Art Practices; 2) course textbook(s) 3) assigned reading of primary source materials (especially artists’ writings) and more specialized scholarly writing.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> This is a Writing Intensive course. In connection with their multiple writing assignments and the essay section of their final exam, students are required to examine contemporary art works firsthand, and to write about them in light of the artists’ own statements about their practices, or in light of critical and scholarly essays concerning those practices. Questions posed to the students with course assignments guide them in approaching their topics in critically-minded and analytical ways.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students are encouraged to contribute to discussion throughout the semester, to argue orally or to position themselves in relation to a range of critical positions regarding Contemporary Art Practices that are outlined for them.  After their first written assignment, some model papers are reviewed with the class as a whole, to further build their awareness of what a well-constructed argument might entail.</p>
<p><strong>CE-1:</strong> Students are introduced to a range of forms of creative expression in the visual arts in the contemporary period (1945 to the present) from artists worldwide. Students are introduced to the necessary specialized terminology of the field, which enables scholars and critics to translate visual objects into textual and oral descriptions that are fundamental to visual analysis. Course lectures present key methodologies used in the discipline of art history, for example, material, formal and contextual analyses. Assignments require the students selectively to apply such methodologies.</p>
<p><strong>CE-2:</strong> In this course, students are dealing with art of the (relatively) recent past and of the present from cultures worldwide. This material is compared and contextualized for students, in broader cultural and political terms, through the lectures and readings.</p>
<p><strong>CE-3:</strong> The issue of how meaning is created in the arts is a particularly live issue in the contemporary period, when traditional modes of art practice are persistently subject to interrogation, revision, and re-imagination. This topic is continually addressed through lectures and readings.</p>
<p><strong>CE-4:</strong> Throughout the course, the lectures and readings both address the highly diverse range of skills involved in Contemporary Art Practices—and address besides the significant impetus evident amongst many contemporary artists towards de-skilled art practices, which purposely call into question conventional assumptions about what art-making must entail.</p>
<p><strong>CE-5:</strong> Students are not asked to do original research. They are asked to build and hone their communication skills through multiple writings assignments, as well as through participation in class discussion.</p>

<h3 id="CEARTH258">ARTH 258 History of Photography [CE]</h3><h4>Approved 2012-12-17</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> This course addresses—through lectures, readings, viewing, and writing assignments— how evidence concerning the History of Photography is acquired and construed and how art historians frame and address questions concerning the wide range of photographic practices worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Photography as a medium entails twinned, social or functional and art/aesthetic histories. Students learn how photographers have consistently made bids to rejoin and enlarge art paradigms at the same times as photography has served centrally as a social and informational medium. A History of Photography course is, of necessity, then, at once a liberal arts course and a form of social studies course.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Over the course of the term, students are required to synthesize information from multiple sources: 1) classroom lectures, which introduce a range of scholarly and critical perspectives on the History of Photography 2) the course textbook 3) assigned readings (made in conjunction with writing assignments and the final exam) of primary source materials and of more specialized scholarly writing.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> In connection with their multiple writing assignments and the essay section of their final exam, students are required to examine photographs firsthand, and to write about them in light of primary source materials or in light of critical and scholarly essays. Detailed questions are posed to the students with each course assignment so as to guide them in approaching their topics in critically-minded and analytical ways.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students are encouraged to contribute to class discussion throughout the semester, to argue orally or to position themselves in relation to a range of critical positions regarding photographic practices that are outlined for them. Students are introduced to the necessary specialized terminology of the field, which enables scholars and critics to translate visual objects into textual descriptions that are fundamental to visual analysis. Course lectures present key methodologies used in the History of Photography, such as ’close reading’ or formal and contextual analyses. Assignments require the students selectively to apply such methodologies.</p>
<p><strong>CE-1:</strong> Students are introduced to the History of Photography at once as a form of functional, and as a form of creative expression in the visual field globally in the modern and contemporary period. Students are introduced to the basic concepts and methods of photography as a creative and/or professional discipline and of photographic history as a scholarly endeavor.</p>
<p><strong>CE-2:</strong> Since the History of Photography has lately become a more globally-oriented field, photographic practices are examined (in this course) with special attention to intra-cultural and cross-cultural factors over the course of the history of the medium, from its founding in the early 19th century to the present.</p>
<p><strong>CE-3:</strong> As students learn, the issue of how meaning is created is a particularly engaging one in the case of the History of Photography, since photographic meaning can often appear, at first sight, to be literal or transparent, yet is generally revealed (upon further analysis) to be highly contingent—not only upon cultural context but also upon matters such as mode of dissemination or delivery, including issues of layout or captioning.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Class members will be assigned to work in small teams, generating original fieldwork focused on specific community needs. Using the skills, methods, and visualizing technologies found in contemporary art each team is tasked with conceptualizing a solution to a particular social challenge. An important aspect of this course is learning how to integrate investigative scholarly fieldwork with creative problem solving expressed through aesthetic modes of artistic imagination as well as well-reasoned argumentation and oral and written evaluation. Of equal significance to this class is learning how to discuss and evaluate social practice art within a broad context of historical, cultural and geopolitical ideas that pivot on concepts of social justice and emancipation. Several short writing assignments are required as well as a written proposal for the final project to be evaluated by the enter class, plus a final written report with research notes is turned in following class presentations at the conclusion of the semester. The type of research questions asked include: What genealogy of art has brought about the existence of such work today? What set of criteria do we need to understand it? And how does this “Social Turn” affect the future of art and in particular, your art education? How does our idea of the other and the concept of race affect our democratic process?  The instructor mediates discussion and directs the class to weigh the claims of artists against actual evidence for social transformation.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Social practice seeks to employ aesthetic methodologies, reflexive observation, and imaginative transformation of material and social relations in the pursuit of realizing social justice. The artist (and in this case the students) generate research about a particular social need or community challenge, evaluate how aesthetic techniques and artistic tactics might address this data, ask who might benefit from a creative project that would focus on this specific problem or problems, and in what possible ways would a process of resolution be approached using the various imaginative criteria social practice artists have been establishing over the past thirty to fifty years both in the United States as well as around the globe.</p>

The instructor mediates discussion and directs the class to weigh the claims of artists</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Five carefully focused writing assignments are required as well as an elaborate, multipart written proposal related to the final project that is evaluated by the professor and the entire class. The class requires students to make several class presentations throughout and at the conclusion of the semester related to the final project. Students are also encouraged to propose specific imaginative solutions to social injustice situations using the criteria of socially engaged visual art and to orally defend their decisions.</p>
<p><strong>CE-1:</strong> These Pathways Flexible Common Core criteria from Creative Expression (CE) are addressed in the syllabus:

- identifies and applies fundamental concepts and methods of social practice art to explore creative expression.

- analyzes how art generated by diverse cultural communities and in varied geographical settings directly relates to and is useful for solving   
  social issues in the present day society.

- demonstrates ways that artistic methods produce knowledge including artistic skills as well as social learning.

- reveals ways that artistic practice communicates data and research about social conditions. 

Two additional Pathways criteria addressed include:

Individual and Society:

- articulates ethical uses of art and data together to respond to specific social issues. 

World Cultures and Global Issues:

- analyzes in a discursive and practical way the role that race, ethnicity, class, gender, language, sexual orientation, belief, or other forms of social differentiation play in world cultures via the visual arts and social practice aesthetics.</p>
<p><strong>CE-2:</strong> Students will examine artistic projects generated in the African American community of Houston Texas; the Spanish-speaking communist world of Havana, Cuba; the multi-lingual/German speaking community of Hamburg, Germany; the African American community of South Side Chicago; the multi-lingual refugee communities in Berlin, Germany; and the Spanish-speaking communities of Corona Queens among other diverse case studies, and see how these past and present art projects relate to current circumstances, especially in the local context of the cultural complex New York City region.</p>
<p><strong>CE-3:</strong> The class is tasked with learning how to discuss and evaluate social practice art within a broad context of historical, cultural and geopolitical ideas that pivot on concepts of social justice and emancipation. How does artistic practice fit into the current social, political, and economic challenges facing society ? How does artistic imagination and communication convey an interpretation of this problems for a positive outcome?</p>
<p><strong>CE-4:</strong> How do aesthetic decisions and artistic criteria relate to and serve to enhance learning about and positively altering challenging social justice related circumstances? This is one of the prime “take-aways” for students in this course. For example, how does African American artist Rick Lowe use his cultural heritage in combination with his background as a visual artist to generate affordable, low-income housing in Houston’s mostly poor and black Third Ward? (See: Activism as Art: Shotgun Shacks Saved Through Art-Based Revitalization: November 22, 2010 in Huffington Post: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gregory-sholette/activism-as-art-shotgun-s_b_785109.html )</p>
<p><strong>CE-5:</strong> Visual learning and communication platforms from online archives to slide presentation software (Power Point / Keynote) will be taught to all students that do not already know these skills, ebooks and pdf format for readings and the possible use of video techniques for research presentations and proposals will also be discussed.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE-3:</strong> This proposed new course for a class of about 12 to 30 in number will fill a substantial gap in both the school and the art department’s undergraduate curriculum regarding the new field of social practice art. Social practice seeks to employ aesthetic methodologies involving the imaginative transformation of materials and the development of reflexive observation and conceptualization with a desire for realizing social justice through the production of critical agency amongst participating individuals and communities. In addition, this class will compliment the existing Social Practice Queens MFA graduate concentration in the QC Art Department.</p>
<h3 id="CECMLIT205">CMLIT 205 Modern Poetry [CE]</h3><h4>Approved 2012-12-17</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> It is difficult to reconcile poetry and data, but close readings of individual poems certainly constitute evidence...of verbal art and the multiplicity of possible significations that words and verbal images can carry.  Questions do not revolve around extracting “meanings” in the narrow sense, but understanding the poem as a verbal artifact, a “machine made out of words” as W.C. Williams put it.  The point is to demystify poetry and make it less forbidding to students.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Studying poetry enables a better appreciation of the power and beauty of words, something often lost in an overly pragmatic, utilitarian society.  Against the corruption of language, modern poetry shows language’s possibilities.  Its study encourages verbal precision and imaginative projection.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Modern poetry is about imagination, not “information.”  It is axiomatic that every poet has a point of view, and to study many poets is to use a variety of sources.  Students use their own judgment as to which poems attract or stimulate them.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Learning techniques of close reading is an important aid in developing habits of precise thinking coupled with imaginative projection.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Oral presentations and interpretive essays are ways in which students can learn to ground themselves in a given text and, above all, to trust the text rather than project extraneous meanings onto it.  Research papers can provide broader understanding of a single poet’s work or deepen comparisons between two poets with similar aesthetic concerns.</p>
<p><strong>CE-1:</strong> Metaphors, verbal play (multiple meanings), verbal music (rhyme and other sonic devices), translation practices, manifestoes (in the case of the poetic avant-garde), associative chains of images — all these elements of a poetics are involved in analyzing poetry.</p>
<p><strong>CE-2:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>CE-3:</strong> Where poetry is concerned, searching for a univocal “meaning” is often fruitless, because “meaning” is communicated through a variety of techniques, from sound to syntax to imagistic associations to resonance with past associations or influences.  Being aware of the multiplicity of possible meanings is more important, as it encourages flexible and imaginative thought.  As well, “experience” may consist in the experience of the poem itself, without any specific autobiographical reference.</p>
<p><strong>CE-4:</strong> How a poem works has as much to do with intangibles as it does with “skills.”  Command of the resources of language is a given with any good poem, and how these resources are deployed will be the subject of discussion and analysis.</p>

<h3 id="CECMLIT215">CMLIT 215 Topics in Modern Literature [CE]</h3><h4>Approved 2012-12-17</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Starting from a shared human experience — e.g., love, death, incarceration, madness, dreams, belief — this course explores how literary works from different cultural settings in the modern world illuminate that experience, in light of the cultural values and influences that shape the different authors’ perceptions.  Students are invited to compare their experiences and perceptions with those articulaed by the various authors.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Modern literature both shapes and is shaped by the dominant cultural attitudes and beliefs in the societies from which it emerges.  It illuminates individual and collective shifts in consciousness and registers chamges and tensions in a given society.  Studying diverse texts that treat a shared experience encourages flexibility of outlook among students.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> By interpreting and analyzing texts from a variety of genres and historical and cultural contexts, centered on a shared human experience, students are able to see these experiences in a many-sided way.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Discussion and analysis of creative works from a diversity of cultures always involves challenges to settled opinions and beliefs, and these will be discussed and written about.  “Arguments” are less the issue here than an understanding of authorial context and ambition.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Essays and a research paper will serve this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>CE-1:</strong> Comparative literature balances discussions of textual matters — aesthetics, formal and rhetorical devices — with the contexts in which the various texts were produced.  Emphasis is placed here on the integrity of the individual work, on authorial strategies and, where applicable, on issues of translation — but always in order to clarify the context of its creation and its implications for the present.</p>
<p><strong>CE-2:</strong> Modern literature’s capacity to transcend its moment and illuminate our time is also a reflection of its ability to capture the moment in which it is created.  Literary works reflect the world around them while presenting that world in a way that communicates to those seemingly distant from the circumstances of its production.  This course explores both context and relevance, while giving preference to neither.</p>
<p><strong>CE-3:</strong> Literary interpretation is crucial to this course — and the cultivation among the students of states of mind and feeling that are capable to responding to texts created at a cultural and temporal distance from the present.  Experiences common to humanity are discussed and analyzed in terms of their real diversity.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives AP Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives AP Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students are introduced to diverse perspectives regarding the cultural, religious, physical, political and historical significance of dance in society through required readings from various sources, as well as video viewings and attending live performances, which highlight the meaning of dance. In class discussions and written assignments require students to articulate their own opinions about dance, and to look at how dance critics and historians have viewed dance through history. Composition assignments and a final original creative project, require students to synthesize various choreographic methodologies with historical and/or current dance traditions and practices.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> The readings, composition assignments, viewing of performances, in class discussions and the different dance forms investigated in class, are designed to give students the tools to analyze, interpret and evaluate dance. Composition assignments encourage critical and analytical thinking by evaluating the logic and structure of a dance composition, identifying its strengths and weaknesses, and possible ways to augment the composition.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Oral presentations are a required component of the course, where students are asked to lead a discussion about a reading and/or give a presentation, for example an analysis of a dance form, discussing its historical context, evolution, influence and current practice. Another assignment might be to compare and contrast two practitioners in the field of dance and discuss their individual philosophy and physical approach to movement. Students are also required to write two review papers analyzing dance performances, both at Queens College and in professional venues. Students need to be able to integrate their observations of the performance with reading assignments, discussions, experience practicing dance forms as well as independent research, to create a well thought out review that balances context, description, interpretation and evaluation. Successive papers need to show an increased understanding of the field and the ability to use critical thinking and analysis as a tool for artistic and personal growth.</p>
<p><strong>CE-1:</strong> Students are introduced to the fundamental concepts of dance (practice, theory, health) and how they connect to larger issues of aesthetics, religion, politics, economics and cultural identity. Students will practice three or more dance forms and discuss their philosophies, as well as read various historical and critical perspectives about each form. In addition they will investigate basic functional anatomy and increase their somatic awareness, ideally developing the skills to be more coordinated and confident in their physical presence and abilities. Through out the course, students work collaboratively to investigate fundamental ideas regarding the craft of choreography (ABA, theme and variation, narrative, space, time, effort, shape, etc.). The course culminates in the showing of a final composition project that integrates ideas explored both in and outside of the class, and that reflects their own point of view.</p>
<p><strong>CE-2:</strong> Students will be introduced to three or more dance forms, and examine the historical evolution and influence of each dance and investigate how it is practiced, what is valued, and the role it serves within society. For example: Students might study the court dances of Japan, Ghana and France, examining their political and cultural significance over time, as well as the cultural values of each society and how those values are reflected in the movement vocabulary and physical training. Students might investigate vernacular dance forms, (ringshouts, clogging, vaudeville, Contra, Lindy, Salsa, Sabar, Capoeira, Native American dances, etc.) and their influence on Jazz, Tap, Hip-Hop, musicals and music videos. Or students might study the evolution of modern dance in America, where each successive generation built upon the structures of the previous generation while responding to the social and political dynamics of their time, to create new forms and understandings.</p>
<p><strong>CE-3:</strong> Through the physical learning of dance forms, students investigate fundamental principles of dance as well as how the body communicates meaning. They will discuss how dance reflects emotions, metaphors, and effects people both physiologically and kinesthetically. In addition students create original dance compositions that include a variety of approaches for structuring movement to create meaning (time, effort, shape and space; narrative and character exploration; theme and variation, ABA structures, etc.). Discussions of compositional studies as well as the dance performance review papers, require students to interpret the meaning of dance works, articulate how meaning is communicated, and examine how individual perspectives influence the construction of meaning.</p>
<p><strong>CE-4:</strong> Composition assignments, attending live performances, class discussions, and the practice of different dance forms will allow students to demonstrate an understanding of the theory and philosophy behind various approaches to dance, as well as work on skills (coordination, body and self awareness, collaboration, the structuring of space, time, effort, shape, etc.) that are fundamental to dance and creativity. The course culminates in a final creative project that requires students to show a practical mastery of these skills.</p>
<p><strong>CE-5:</strong> Students are required to use the library and internet resources (jstor, VAST, youtube, vimeo) for assignments and when conducting their individual research. The writing of blogs on line (epsilen, wordpress) require students to respond to readings and videos discussed in class, as well as to write constructive responses to each other’s blog posts. For oral presentations, students are encouraged to provide a demonstration of the dance form being discussed either through live embodiment, video or PowerPoint.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives AP Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives AP Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students are asked to read and analyze plays and texts on acting technique and principles by celebrated teachers (such as Stanislavsky and Uta Hagen).  Through research, both visual (such as paintings and photographs) and literary, students also become aware of social differences in behavior and mores of other time periods in order to create a fully realized character.  These characters may come from a play, a poem, a movie, and a television script or even from a photograph.  For example, to help students get in touch with their abilities to create through imagination, “The Family of Man”, a book of photographs from the forties and fifties of many cultures is introduced as research.  As an assignment students are asked to give an oral presentation of their opinions about these texts, writings and photographs and to explain how they have used these tools and information in the creative process. Each oral presentation will be followed by a class discussion of the points presented and a comparison of the various views expressed by other students. Elements of acting for the stage and public speaking will be examined and debated after additional oral presentations. (“Acting, the First Six Lessons” compared to “How to Overcome Public Speaking Fear”). The course provides students the opportunity to understand the strong connections (relationship) between seemingly different perspectives (points of view) such as public speaking and the methods and techniques of acting.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Students must discuss and evaluate each others work in class informed by what they have read, acting techniques that have been taught, and whether the characterization is truthful to the author’s point of view.  Through readings, exercises and improvisational assignments students will have the tools to examine performances presented.  Students become aware of how their past experiences, behavior and physical presence more fully develop self awareness and allow their individual voice to surface in performance and criticism.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Oral presentations, such as the character analysis of the photos in “The Family of Man” and a comparison of public speaking techniques and acting skills , monologues, dialogues and improvisations are presented throughout the semester.  Three papers (4-5 pages in length) critiquing performances, both at Queens and in professional venues are required.  These papers must reflect what has been learned from the readings and what has been experienced in performing and other oral exercises.  Each progressive paper should reveal more depth in understanding the creative process.  A journal is also required.  Students must make entries after each class and or outside assignments expressing what they experienced and how the class or assignment not only develops acting skills, but how they connect to “real live” behavior.</p>
<p><strong>CE-1:</strong> Drama 100 introduces the student to the basic elements and techniques of acting and it investigates the foundations of the creative process and collaboration.  Theatrical drama develops skills enabling a person to be more present, articulate and assured in any career path chosen. Many hours are spent developing collaborative partnerships in doing simple acting improvisations or more complex scene study exercises.  Actors analyze scripts for performance and the readings required for class and the outside performances viewed reinforce the exploration of creative expression.</p>
<p><strong>CE-2:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>CE-3:</strong> Through acting exercises, such as the performance of a monologue or the analysis of a performance in the required papers, students will apply fundamental principles of acting and discuss how these principles are used to convey complex emotions or experiences (life experiences).  Students create characters from their individual experiences and emotional abilities to understand human relationships.  Since no two people express anger, sadness, fear, love, loneliness or happiness exactly the same each student must creates from their own sense memory - the stored experiences that are unique to each person.  Talent cannot be taught; it is innate.  But with careful and thorough investigation of self-expression and self-awareness it can grow and flourish.  Development of these communication skills through “doing” is what this course can achieve.</p>
<p><strong>CE-4:</strong> Live performances, exercises and class discussions will allow students to demonstrate mastery of script analysis, oral presentation, collaboration, acting technique and self-awareness – all components of the creative process.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Previously approved for the Perspectives AP Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Previously approved for the Perspectives AP Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students are asked to read and analyze plays from a designer’s perspective, comparing and contrasting how designers view and use theater texts and research with how other theater artists (i.e. dramaturgs, directors, actors) use these same texts. Students create original design projects that must incorporate evidence found in the play text, primary historical research, current events, design and color theory, and knowledge of technical theater concepts. They discuss their own opinions about the meaning of these texts, as well as looking at how literary critics and theater historians have viewed these works through history.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Students provide research for all projects that must consist of primary source historical research, as well as other visual research that supports their analysis of the text. They must look at historical sources of visual research and evaluate whether the images are relevant to the design concept they have chosen based on information in the play’s texts and their own opinions of the playwright’s work. They must discuss and evaluate each other’s research deciding whether or not it supports their view of the play in oral presentations that accompany each project.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Oral presentation is a required component of all class projects. Students must defend their own research and choices, using specific examples from the play text and primary sources of visual research appropriate to the play’s time period. They must also discuss and critically evaluate the work of other class members.</p>
<p><strong>CE-1:</strong> Students learn the fundamental concepts of stage design (Scenery, Lighting, Costumes, and Sound) and they must place these concepts within the larger discipline of Theater Arts. In-class discussion of play texts also involves discussing topics such as the  importance of theater as an art form, the significance of each individual work, how assigned plays reflect the values of the society that is the play’s intended audience, and how those plays relate to an audience in contemporary American society. Each project addresses one to three design disciplines. The first four projects that address fundamental concepts of design such as research, collaboration, play analysis, and creative problem solving.</p>
<p><strong>CE-2:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>CE-3:</strong> Students create original design projects that must demonstrate how abstract concepts expressed in a play’s texts can be translated and realized through the visual design of the play. They must demonstrate a mastery of using visual images as metaphors for emotion and experience.</p>
<p><strong>CE-4:</strong> Each of the five projects on the syllabus calls upon students to master different skills in the creative process, culminating the in final project, where students put all their acquired knowledge together and collaborate on an original stage design for an opera. The projects require students to demonstrate a practical mastery of these skills.</p>
<p><strong>CE-5:</strong> Students are required to use both library and internet resources to conduct their research. They are encouraged to use digital cameras, mP3 technology on their sound project, and to create presentations using PowerPoint. They are also encouraged to us Photoshop or Cad drawing to express their concepts or ideas, in addition to traditional hand rendering methods.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> (No. 1 of 3 needed) Students are asked to view and analyze films from an interdisciplinary perspective. They will analyze films in the historical and cultural contexts in which they were made and understand their meanings; they will also study the film with respect to important concepts that make the film possible such as lighting, costume, mise-en-scene, and the role of the director, the script and or references to literature. Students will acquire information about the complexity of film not only from the point of view of its story, but also consider its aesthetic, historical and formal perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> (No. 2 of 3 needed) Students are required to write and present their work and support it through research and close analysis, focusing on specific scenes, segments and shot sequences. They must demonstrate that they are able to interpret the meanings underlying a particular film. For example, they will be able to express their opinions and compare and contrast the cinematic style of a single director or with an aesthetic movement (such as Modernism). During in class discussion, students will demonstrate their ability to support an argument and validate it with critical material and informed interpretation.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> (No. 3 of 3 needed) Students are required to write about one or more films, covering a different aspect of the course theme. They must gather information and material in order to understand the complexity of, for example historical representation in film, and place this in the wider context of Greek and/or European filmmaking. In class discussions students will have the chance to express their ideas and informed opinions vis-a-vis the topics discussed in the film class, such as nationalism, modernity, the role of women in society, etc. The midterm and final will test students’ general knowledge of Greek film within the European traditions discussed in class.</p>
<p><strong>CE-1:</strong> (No. 1 of 3 needed) Students in the class will learn the critical language of film and the specific vocabulary to use when analyzing film. In addition, students will learn the important aesthetic movements that inform Greek cinema. Further, students will explore whether traditional concepts of a “national” cinema are still possible or relevant within a globalizing, “multicultural” society.</p>
<p><strong>CE-2:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>CE-3:</strong> (No. 2 of 3 needed) Students will discuss how Greek cinema reflects the wider social context within which it was produced, as well as the place of film within the broader range of the liberal arts; focusing on the history and development of film as performing art in Greece will illustrate how Greek film reflects the culture of Greece.  Students will examine Greek film within the wider context of both European and Hollywood film, with discussions of influences and comparisons of specific genres.</p>
<p><strong>CE-4:</strong> (No. 3 of 3 needed) Students must demonstrate their ability to master the theoretical concepts for analyzing film and engage in creative analysis. In the case of Greek cinema, they will demonstrate knowledge of Greek and European historical and cultural traditions and analyze the creative trajectories of various actors and directors. This will aid them in exploring the idea of creativity and the creative process across national and cultural boundaries.</p>

<p><strong>QC-2:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives AP Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> HNRS 125 is taught by faculty from Art, Music, Theatre, Dance, or other disciplines that focus on the visual or performing arts. During the semester, students attend various theatrical, operatic, and musical performances, exhibitions of visual art, and other highlights of the current cultural season in New York. In addition to experiencing these art forms as an audience, students are encouraged to examine performances and exhibitions from the multiple perspectives of scholarship, creativity, and production.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> By writing frequently about these and other examples of the visual and performing, students develop their critical, analytical and communication skills. To enhance their appreciation of these artistic experiences, students investigate the social, historical, and aesthetic content of the cultural work being performed and exhibited.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students are required to develop arguments concerning their interpretation of an artistic production.  These arguments are supported by reference to the artistic text (art work, play, opera, photograph, etc.) and by reference to research they have conducted into the social, historic, and artistic contexts of selected works of art or performance.  Class debates and discussions provide additional opportunities for students to gain skills in presenting arguments and using evidence to support conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>CE-1:</strong> This course is interdisciplinary; students are introduced to at least three artistic disciplines  from the visual arts and performing arts and learn to apply the critical discourse and methods of these disciplines in evaluating their responses to different art forms.  Students further investigate relationships across art forms and analyze similarities and differences in the critical approaches employed by different disciplines.</p>
<p><strong>CE-2:</strong> The course may be designed to focus on art by, about, and/or for historical marginalized minority groups.</p>
<p><strong>CE-3:</strong> Students will discuss in class and in their written responses to artistic works the ways that artists can serve as political and social voices for their communities  Students will also evaluate the ways that artists preserve and reflect important cultural values and events for the wider human population.  Students will write about and reflect on the work they see as well as create their own original work that reflects their views of the current cultural moment in New York City.</p>
<p><strong>CE-4:</strong> The culminating project for the course is Snapshot NYC in which students use a range of technologies to take photographs that reflect their relationship to their community.  The photographs from this event are then mounted as a photography exhibition.  Students meet at the exhibit to discuss with each other and faculty the varieties of visual and social experiences presented by the photographs.</p>
<p><strong>CE-5:</strong> Students are required to use both library and internet resources to conduct their research. They are encouraged to use digital cameras for the Snapshot NYC project.  They are also encouraged to develop e-portfolios of their work and to blog about their experiences of the various art performances and art works they engage in the class.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students in Introduction to Music courses listen to recordings, watch videos, read original and secondary source material and attend live concert performances.  Through these various means, they gather information about the musical elements (Melody, harmony, rhythm, texture, dynamics, etc.), elements of musical style (Renaissance, Baroque, Classical Romantic and Modern Eras) and general historical context that allow them to interpret and assess stylistic distinctions among composers, countries, genres, instruments, cultures and traditions.  Typically, these criteria are explored across a broad range of historical periods (usually from about 800 until the mid 20th Century) incorporating a wide variety of points of view (technical and historical) and incorporating contemporary (Modern 21st Century) and historical (Period specific) points of view. The attached syllabus demonstrates the methodology in the section marked “Navigating the course and syllabus.”</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Students will evaluate musical criteria, comparing formal and structural distinctions between genres within a particular style period and also comparing and contrasting formal designs from one period to another, and from one cultural tradition to another through a combination of directed listening and readings.  Students will also integrate and analyze historical criteria as a force that shapes and influences cultural and technical developments in musical genres, as well as the influence of the visual and other performing arts. This methodology is illustrated in the portion of the attached syllabus marked “Study suggestions.”</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students take exams, write papers and produce reports using evidence found in readings, in musical recordings and at live performances incorporating vocabulary, listening techniques, and analytical tools developed during the course of guided listening in class. Students write at least one report after attending a live concert.  The report brings together technical and historical information about the concert and also asks the student to conduct research and provide a Bibliography.  In this way, the student demonstrates the ability to coordinate and apply the abstract and historical knowledge of the course.  See “Concert Report Guidelines” in the attached syllabus.</p>
<p><strong>CE-1:</strong> Music is a highly abstract medium.  It has its own criteria, vocabulary, formal structures, performance history, and expressive criteria.  Students in Music 1 will explore Music Literature, learn to use the vocabulary necessary to describe it, and then apply those tools to a variety of examples within the discipline and also apply those concepts and use that vocabulary to compare and contrast related disciplines such as the visual arts and dance. The attached syllabus demonstrates the introduction and application of the elements of music (see Classes 1 - 11 for topics such as rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, dynamics and form.)</p>
<p><strong>CE-2:</strong> Each example of musical literature will be explored within the context of the historical, political and social environment which produced it.  Western and Non-Western cultures will be explored and contrasted both for what such exercises have to teach about a particular example of music, as well as what this type of study can tell us about the study of music in general. Implicit in the attached syllabus is the inclusion of relevant historical data as found in the Kamien “Music: An Appreciation” reading assignments that accompany classes 13 - 28.</p>
<p><strong>CE-3:</strong> Music is a highly communicative medium, but it is also the most abstract of the arts.  Abstract (absolute) musical styles and genres (which can only be interpreted in terms of the abstract qualities and evidence of the musical material) will be compared and contrasted with other stylistic and historical trends (The Doctrine of the Affections in the Baroque in classes 13, 16, 17; the emergence of “Program Music” in the 19th Century, for example) that attempt to endow musical gestures and textures with specific meaning. Students will learn to distinguish not only how meaning is conveyed in music, but context and technical understanding can enhance the ability of music to communicate and thus the listener to perceive.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Accounting 261 students analyze the basic structures through which the law is implemented and enforced in the context of social forces operating in our society. Students read the U.S. Constitution, court decisions and statutes to develop an understanding of how our basic legal principles reflect our society’s culture, ethics and values. We examine specific areas of law such as contracts, torts, crimes and constitutional rights from cases and classroom hypotheticals. The sources for making decisions include prior case law, common law legal rules and equitable maxims, statutory law, ethical mandates and an evaluation of the social framework in which the issues arise.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> We discuss various court cases and hypotheticals  and  evaluate the underlying fact patterns orally and in written essay form (factual analysis and evaluation) , develop the legal issues or questions which arise from those facts (issue recognition) , and address the competing interests and arguments generated by our adversarial  legal system (analyze the positions of competing interests).</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students orally brief cases and analyze hypothetical fact patterns in class and in a written essay on their exam. The essay presents fact patterns similar to those cases and fact patters in the regular classroom discussions,  for the legal areas studied. The essay asks them to identify the applicable legal issues and principles  just as they do in class, and explain how they would determine the outcome of the case.</p>
<p><strong>IS-1:</strong> Common  law, the Consittution and equitable principles express society values.   We specifically examine the natural, positivist and historical schools of jurisprudential thought.  Social science principles and statistics in areas such as sociology, psychology, economics, and religion are used, as in a the “Brandeis brief”,   to support legal decisions and statutory law. The Individual accountability  inherent in the law of torts depends upon economists calculations to quantify liability. The philosophical and ethical principles  of the proper balance of state power and core individual rights and due process are reflectected in Constitutional law.  Views from the fields of economics, sociology and psychology are reflected in the laws used to deal with criminal conduct.  Economic principles drive tax law.</p>
<p><strong>IS-2:</strong> The course addresses the balance between freedom and security, efficiency and empathy.  What we view as the appropriate balancing of competing interests often springs from our place in Society.  Students are challenged in class to see that point of balance and articulate how the various rules of both statutory and common law attempt to adjust it.  Students must articulate the competing choices, and the perceived benefits and burdens of specific rules of law, in both oral form in class questioning, and in writing through an analysis of hypothetical fact patters in an essay exam that often has no one right answer.</p>
<p><strong>IS-3:</strong> We study the values of the various schools of jurisprudential thought, and the basic nature and limitations of law and the ethical expression inherent in our common and statutory law.  Students discuss their view of the ethical integrity of specific rules of law as to  how effectively they implement  and  promote our basic societal values.</p>
<p><strong>IS-4:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IS-5:</strong> Students will study the impact of legal precedent on individuals’ personal and professional decision making as well as the way such decision-making shapes a society’s legal environment of individual rights and obligations.</p>

<p><strong>QC-2:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives CV Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Readings and discussions highlight different points of view, genres, and disciplinary and research traditions, contrasting the writings of linguistic anthropologists, sociolinguists, cognitive linguists, political activists, journalists, language users, and others to illustrate competing perspectives on the nature of language in socio-cultural context. Readings also expose students to data collected using a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods including ethnographic observation, interviews, sociolinguistic experiments, surveys and questionnaires, and transcribed audio and video recordings.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Students read scholarly and journalistic works and case studies that exemplify techniques of critical analysis and learn through class discussion to understand competing arguments, evaluate the logic and evidence on which they are based, and identify their strengths and weaknesses. For example, through the critical assessment of the verbal deprivation theories, students learn about the nature of language and its role in society and culture and how misconceptions and faulty methodologies by so-called experts have in the past been used to justify prejudices and discriminatory views and practices. Students will also learn to evaluate various competing views such as linguistic &amp; cultural relativist and universalist perspectives on language structure.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Through a combination of various kinds of graded activities (homework assignments, in-class exams, oral presentations and written essays), students learn to marshal evidence from readings, lectures, and observations, and to produce well-reasoned arguments using evidence that address descriptive, interpretive, and policy concerns at stake in the study of language in its socio-cultural context. For example, students may be asked (a) to evaluate the linguistic relativity theory and present an argument using evidence for or against this theory; (b) to evaluate the verbal deprivation theory in terms of assumptions, evidence, methodology, and reasoning, and to construct their own hypothesis regarding the poor school performance among African American children, and describe kinds of data to be used as evidence and suitable data collection methods; (c) to construct their arguments for or against English-only laws in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>IS-1:</strong> The course introduces students to the field of linguistic anthropology, an interdisciplinary study that focuses on how language users learn and use language within specific sociocultural contexts and how they participate in transformations of cultures and societies. Language is by its nature an intimately personal yet at the same time unquestionably social phenomenon. Individuals learn a language not only through acquiring grammatical competence, but also through being socialized into an understanding of the culturally preferred ways of interacting, expressing feelings, and participating in community life. Individuals make thousands of linguistic choices every day, all of which have an impact on social life and eventually language itself. Language issues are compelling to CUNY students, who come from diverse backgrounds. Though many students start the course thinking of language as a neutral medium, they become increasingly aware of how linguistic communication shapes and can be shaped by culture, inter-personal relations, and power dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>IS-2:</strong> Linguistic anthropologists have pioneered the study of language attitudes and ideologies and how these may shape everyday language practice and individuals’ social values, experiences, and choices: it is on the basis of linguistic evidence that many of us evaluate and act upon the world around us. Yet attitudes toward language and the ways in which we use it are highly dependent on social and cultural factors and on an individual’s place in society. Through reading case studies, students explore how social structures and identities (categorized in terms of ethnicity, gender, socio-economic class, region, and generation) both help construct and are constructed through language practices. One of the important points that this course is designed to address is that non-standard dialects have grammars of their own. These language varieties are often associated with particular social groups and used as a justification for discrimination against them. The course will devote a section, for example, to examine African American English, in particular its grammar, its historical development, its use, and misunderstanding of and prejudice toward it as revealed by verbal deprivation theory and Ebonics controversy.</p>
<p><strong>IS-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IS-4:</strong> Research ethics involving human subjects is an important focus of the course.  Not only do students learn about university standards of academic integrity in conducting library and web-based research, they are also taught to evaluate the ethical strengths and weakness of collecting and analyzing data in a range of ways. In particular, they come to appreciate the difficulties of eliciting, transcribing, storing, and publishing data in ways that safeguard the dignity of the research subject. Students are also asked to consider the ethical consequences of using research findings to implement social change. For instance, what position should researchers adopt if, when studying language revitalization, they find that members of a local community do not all agree about which language variety should be revitalized or whether the language should be revitalized at all?</p>
<p><strong>IS-5:</strong> Through the analysis of detailed case studies, students learn to identify and engage in debates about how colonialism, nationalism, missionization, globalization, and indigenous movements have transformed lives of individuals and communities – in particular, their language practices and attitudes – around the world.  For example, students will examine ethnolinguistic studies of language shift in colonial and post-colonial nation-states, decision-making and other processes involved in establishing national languages for newly independent states, maintenance or revitalization of heritage or indigenous languages in local schools and communities, and adoption of global English. Students will examine socio-cultural, economic, and political factors in individual language choice (e.g., abandoning one’s heritage language, making language related educational decisions for themselves and their children) and analyze sociolinguistic and other consequences of such decisions (e.g., birth of new dialects and languages such as creoles, introduction and nativization of colonial languages, development of new kinds of linguistic hierarchy and multilingualism, language shift and death).</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Information is gathered, interpreted, and assessed from two types of sources: data provided primarily by government agencies (included in textbooks and accessible online); written material that reports on the state of the economy and alternative views regarding whether, or what kind of, government action is desirable. The written material is available within standard textbooks, online homework modules, and publications such as magazines, newspapers, and (to a lesser extent at the introductory level) economics journals.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Classroom discussions, homework and exams require that students be able to evaluate the validity of arguments made in favor of economic policies (e.g., how does a tax on gasoline affect consumption of gasoline and automobiles, their prices, and pollution?; how does a Federal Reserve policy of “quantitative easing” affect employment and inflation?).</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Exams require students to evaluate economic policies using the tools of analysis (e.g., microeconomic supply and demand curves, aggregate supply and demand curves), as well as clear written explanations of what the graphic analysis indicates. Policies such as those cited immediately above are the kinds of issues to be examined. Ten homework assignment require students to read an article from the popular economics press (e.g., The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Economist) and answer in expository writing and with graphic analysis a series of questions concerning the nature and validity of the arguments. Examples of topics: the impact of the minimum wage; the efficacy of a policy of quantitative easing. Writing will be graded based not only on the economic content but also on the care of preparation (grammar, spelling, logic). Each paper will be a minimum of 1.5 double-spaced pages and a maximum of three pages.</p>
<p><strong>IS-1:</strong> This course first covers the elements of behavior that determine demand and supply. (Households or individuals make economic decisions in order to maximize their happiness, satisfaction, or “utility.”  Firms function with the primary goal of maximizing profits.)  After establishing these microeconomic basics, the course moves on to develop the workings of the macroeconomy (aggregates of consumption, investment, government spending and issues of employment, unemployment, inflation, and growth).  Then the focus is on macroeconomic policy:  How does government address the issues of unemployment and inflation?  How can the government promote economic growth? The microeconomic basics provide insight into the forces that shape the macroeconomy.  Much of the analysis uses graphs and some basic mathematics to explore these micro- and macro- relationships. Hence, the course builds on the relationship between individuals and overall economic society, as well as how societal (policy decisions) affect the individual.</p>
<p><strong>IS-2:</strong> An individual’s position in the economy (worker or nonworker, nature of employment, wealth status, family structure) and experience are shaped both by the economy and by individual choice, the degree of choice itself a function of economic status.  This position, in addition to values independent of economic status, shape each individual’s view of the appropriate role of government with respect to influencing the economy—and these views are often a key factor in shaping who governs and what policies are pursued.  Thus, studying how economic decisions are made, how income is determined,  how the economy functions, and how government policy affects the economy all link an individual’s place to their experience, values, and choices.  While values are shaped to some extent by economic circumstances, there are other independent forces that determine these.</p>
<p><strong>IS-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IS-4:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IS-5:</strong> Many economic trends are identified in this course, which covers the basics of both microeconomics and macroeconomics. The major trends examined are the distribution of income across individual households and by economic role (e.g., worker vs. owner), unemployment, inflation, growth, government spending, and taxation, primarily in the United States.  However, trends in other countries are also examined.  These trends affect the lives of individuals and how they vote.  How government reverses negative trends (and the extent to which government involves itself in the economy) is central to the course; the government response has a major impact on the lives of individuals, with impact differing by a person’s position in the world of work or position with respect to ownership of financial assets.  Because of competing objectives and concerns, not all individuals will view the responses of government the same way. (For example, someone working in an industry that competes with imported goods, e.g., automobiles) will feel differently about a tariff on autos than will a general consumer.)</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-1:</strong> Economics 100 does not satisfy a requirement for either an economics, a BBA, or an accounting major.  It is designed to be a course for nonmajors.

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students will be required to gather, interpret, and assess information from two types of sources: data provided primarily by government agencies (accessible online); written material that reports on the state of the economy and alternative views regarding whether, or what kind of, government action is desirable. The written material is available within standard textbooks, online homework modules, and publications such as magazines, newspapers, and (to a lesser extent at the introductory level) economics journals.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Students will be required to evaluate the validity of arguments made in favor of economic policies (e.g., how does a policy of “quantitative easing” by the Federal Reserve affect interest rates, inflation, employment, and economic growth? Will a permanent or temporary tax cut have a bigger impact on consumer spending?). Students will be required to think critically and analytically in order to answer homework and examination questions. These can be either multiple choice or short answer questions. Students need to be prepared to answer questions during class discussions. Aplia homework requires students to be able to develop graphic analyses and to answer questions about the implications of the graphic analysis. Other homework assignments require examination of data and its implications (e.g., is a tax system progressive, proportional, or regressive, and why? What has happened to the price level over time, and which groups are helped or hurt by these changes?).</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students will be required on both homework and exams to evaluate economic policies using the tools of analysis (e.g., aggregate supply and demand curves, Keynesian analysis) or data on the economy. Some exam and homework questions will require written answers that rely on evidence in the form of graphic analysis or data on the economy.  For instance, the Aplia homework module provides brief “news analyses” discussing economic issues, such as the consequences of deflation, that pose discussion questions requiring written submissions by students. Some instructors may use newspaper articles as the basis of the writing assignments. Students will be asked to respond to questions about the workings of the macroeconomy and policy as a part of class discussions.</p>
<p><strong>IS-1:</strong> Students learn to identify and apply the fundamental concepts of macroeconomics through reading assignments and class discussion; homework and exam questions help to strengthen analytical abilities and understanding. Students first learn the elements of behavior of both households and firms. After establishing these microeconomic basics, students moves on to explore the workings of the macroeconomy (aggregates of consumption, investment, government spending and issues of employment, unemployment, inflation, and growth).  Once students understand the way in which, and how well, the macroeconomy works, they examine the tools of policy that address the fundamental macroeconomic issues:  How does government address the issues of unemployment and inflation?  How can the government promote economic growth?  Much of the analysis uses graphs and some mathematics. By starting with the microeconomic focus on the individual and moving toward the functioning of the macroeconomy, students learn the relationship between the individual and society. Students strengthen their understanding through reading assignments, class discussions, and homework.</p>
<p><strong>IS-2:</strong> Students can understand how an individual’s position as a student, an employee or an entrepreneur or a corporate executive—or as a retiree living on a relatively fixed income—influences how he or she will evaluate the desirability of economic policies.  For example, there are trade-offs between a policy that is concerned with fighting inflation (calling for a restrictive monetary and fiscal policy) and one that is concerned with stimulating employment (an expansive fiscal and monetary policy). Students learn how an individual’s position is affected by such alternative policies (for example, retirees on fixed incomes are hurt by inflation, while a household with a fixed-rate mortgage may well benefit, paying back with “cheaper” dollars). By knowing the impact of a macroeconomic problem on his/her own experience, a student (or any other individual) develops a set of values and choices with respect to what economic policies are favored. The ability to think analytically and critically, skills developed through reading, homework, and class discussion lays the foundation for examining the relationship between the individual and society.</p>
<p><strong>IS-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IS-4:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IS-5:</strong> Using both data and the tools of analysis, students learn to identify the major trends such as unemployment, inflation, and economic growth, with a focus on the United States.  However, they also examine the experiences of other countries. In the United States, these  economic patterns have a major impact on the lives of individuals and how they vote.  Students examine how the government response to these problems has a major impact on the lives of individuals (including themselves), with impact differing by a person’s position in the world of work or position with respect to wealth.  Because of competing economic positions, objectives and concerns, not all individuals will view the responses of government the same way—even students within the same classroom. (For example, a worker in an industry that competes with imported goods, such as automobiles, will view tariffs quite differently from the general consumer.) The individual’s response shapes how he or she votes and thus influences collective decision-making by government. The ability to think analytically and critically, skills developed through reading, homework, and class discussion, lays the foundation for examining the relationship between the individual and society.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Homework assignments will require student to gather, interpret, and asses information from two types of sources:  data provided primarily by government agencies (included in textbooks and accessible online); written material that reports on the state of the economy and alternative views regarding whether, or what kind of, government action is desirable.  The written material is incorporated into standard textbooks, online homework modules (e.g., Aplia Econ Portal, Connect), and publications such as magazines, newspapers, and (to a lesser extent at the introductory level) economics journals. The written material incorporates a variety of points of view. For instance, Paul Krugman writing opinion pieces in The New York Times will have a different point of view on the practice of trade policy and the benefits of free trade than will George Will, who writes opinion pieces in The Washington Post. In class discussion and on exams students might be required to determine the extent to which the two agree vs. disagree—and their own views on the quality of the different arguments.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Students will be required on both homework and examines to be able to evaluate critically and analytically two types of evidence.  One type of evidence is theoretical in the form of graphic analysis of economic activity of either households or firms. For instance, when supply or demand (curves) change in particular ways, what are the possible explanations?  When cost curves change, what are the possible explanations?  Homework assignments in online homework modules  and exam questions requires students to be able to evaluate this type of theoretical evidence.  The other kind of evidence is in the form of data or specific facts about how the economy has changed.For example, drawing on evidence from readings about what has been happening in energy markets, what are the possible  explanations behind the rapid increases in electricity prices in California: Do the price increases reflect actual scarcity or some sort of monopolization of the market? Homework assignment require students to read about such changes in the economy and answer questions about what has happened and what policies might address revealed problems.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> In homework and on exams, students will be required to produce diagrammatic (using graphs) and written explanations of how the economy works as well as how government can affect the functioning of the economy.  For example, students will need to be able to graph changes in supply and demand curves to show what happens when incomes or consumer preferences change (demand) or what happens when costs of inputs rise (supply); or how the market for automobiles would be affected if government decided to impose an increase in the gasoline tax vs. mandating producers to install catalytic converters as alternative mechanisms to discourage pollution. There will be two writing assignments, one at midterm and one near the end of the semester, based on readings to be assigned.  These assignments will challenge a student’s thinking by requiring her/him to clarify microeconomic concepts and apply critical reasoning. For example, in one “news analysis” assignment in Aplia, students first do problems associated with the over-use of resources with undefined property rights (fishing in the ocean) and then are asked for written responses, such as how this issue relates to the problem of air pollution and what possible solutions are, based on the evidence presented in the news analysis. Each assignment will be double-spaced, a minimum of 2 pages, and a maximum of 3 pages. These will be graded based on both their economic content as well as the care taken in the writing (grammar, spelling, logic). Some sections may use newspaper articles or book chapters as the basis of these short writing assignments.</p>
<p><strong>IS-1:</strong> In readings and class lectures and discussion, students learn the basic microeconomic concepts of the laws of supply and demand to understand how a market economy works. They first explore the factors that shape individual or household economic behavior, and then the behavior of firms.  Putting these two pieces together, students explore how supply (behavior of firms) and demand (behavior of households) interact to shape the market place, and how that market place is altered when there is a lack of competition or the presence of third-party effects, such as pollution. Students use the tools of analysis (supply and demand curves, cost and revenue curves) to explore the interrelationship between individual action and societal (market) outcome.  Homework assignments and exams require students to apply the tools of analysi in order to understand the relationship between individual behavior and market or societal outcomes and how government can affect the societal outcome through alternative policies—or what the adverse consequences of government intervention might be (e.g., when government has instituted policies of agricultural price supports).  In some sections, students engage in “experiments” (Aplia, the homework module provides these) in which they play roles and are then able to understand how their individual behavior can shape market outcomes. (One such experiment is described below.)</p>
<p><strong>IS-2:</strong> In readings and class lectures and discussion, students explore how market outcomes are shaped by each individual’s place in society—that place being a function not only of economic position, but also personal values (ideology)—the latter often being a function of the former. The nature and extent of intervention that individuals deem appropriate are shaped by both of these individual economic circumstances and ideology. For example, a farmer will have a different view on the desirability of milk price supports than will the general consumer, who pays more for food as a result of these supports, as the tools of economic analysis reveal. In another example, the tools of economics help students understand that households may indeed bear the cost of the tax on a corporation (that things are not as they appear on the surface). Economics as a discipline provides the methodology to help students evaluate alternative outcomes, but the selection of the policy is a political decision, one in which students as voters will shape the societal outcome. To give more direct appreciation of these relationships, as part of the Aplia homework module, students might participate in classroom “experiments” in which they play roles to see the relationship between their individual behavior and the market outcomes.  For instance, one experiment explores “the tragedy of the commons”—that shared resources with undefined property rights, such as common pastures or rivers, tend to be depleted too quickly from a societal perspective.  Each student in the experiment plays the role of a member of a small community in which each individual’s goal is to catch as much fish from a lake as possible. This experiment demonstrates what happens to essential resources when property rights are not defined and helps students understand the role government regulation can play to prevent rapid resource depletion.</p>
<p><strong>IS-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IS-4:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IS-5:</strong> Through both data and readings, students explore major trends such as the distribution of income (across households and economic sectors, such as labor vs. corporations, and  tendencies toward concentration in various industries), government revenues and spending, imports and exports, and changing trends in government intervention in the market. In addition, readings and class discussions explore the interrelationships of the economic and politic worlds, in which causality may flow in both directions. A question that students might be asked to write about or discuss in class is whether increasing inequality in the income distribution is the result of market forces that government needs to address, and/or whether the actions of government (through tax or spending policies) are themselves a source of increasing inequality brought about by the influence of individuals or corporations with disproportionate economic—and consequently, political—power.  An individual’s response to the existing patterns in the economy that directly affect his or her own economic status shapes how he or she votes and thus influences collective decision-making by government. The ability to think analytically and critically about these issues, skills developed through reading, homework, and class discussion, lays the foundation for examining the relationship between the individual and society. In their own lives, students can use their understanding of economic analysis together with economic trends to shape their own participation in collective decision-making, that is, to help them decide what policies to support through their votes.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> The students will explore fashion and its impact on and exchanges with historical, cultural, and societal events from 1900 to the present. Fashion is chronologically addressed via historic analysis of artworks, documentary evidence, and material culture artifacts from the Queens College Costume Collection, in order to investigate the individual’s place in society relative to the status quo, economic, political, and ethical concerns.  The class offers students hands-on experience working with original historic garments and accessories ranging from working class dress to opulent couture items. Students assess and evaluate the singular qualities of material culture artworks and designs, the complexities in how the objects convey cross-cultural meanings, and how they reveal the play of greater societal norms and technological developments on the individual body.  In weekly discussions, students pose questions and/or observations from the readings and lectures.  In three reflective essays they argue societal, cultural and historic positions relating to fashion and the individual for each period.  They are asked to identify and analyze markers of dress in class discussions and on exams. Fashion and its representation will also be evaluated using film clips and a visit to a costume exhibition to appraise new research and curatorial concerns. Through these activities, and through research of primary sources and scholarly journals, students will be exposed to the multi-faceted nature of costume studies.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> The class offers students a unique multidisciplinary understanding of Western history, culture, and society, through exposure to multiple artworks and original artifacts.  Fashion is part of the zeitgeist, and as such, there are exchanges and reflections of social and political events, and the arts, design, and architectural developments within it, and that it also influences. The course therefore gives students access to a wide swathe of socio-cultural history, and the ability to contextualize fashion, the individual, and society within these historic events. It also offers them the invaluable exposure to the practice of working with material culture artifacts in order to understand history through objects, and how they impacted the individual.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students work with artifacts, examine fashion and dress in artworks from artistic renderings to documentary evidence, read primary research texts, scholarly texts, and blogs, visit museums and view multi-media presentations. Insight is gained into who is writing, creating, and curating, and from what point of view, so that students have the tools to look critically and understand socio-cultural biases across time. This enables students to be the best scholars possible, and to allow them the most comprehensive understanding of the significance of fashion and the individual through history.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> In class discussions, artworks and idealized imagery are contrasted with documentary photography and original fashions in order to discuss body ideals across time.  Using both texts and images, primary sources are compared with secondary ones, to examine how objects are re-written and culturally re-contextualized according to prevailing practices in all eras.  In class, historic fashions, accessories, and textiles are examined and critically evaluated by students to understand how these objects are not separate from the individual and their identity, and how they are used in social processes.  The portrayal of fashion in film is questioned to identify artistic license and to compare it with the respective era’s dress norms.  Museum exhibitions and scholarly practices are investigated, along with curatorial points of view and how they reflect present currents of interest associated with contemporary society.  Through a research paper and oral argument, students argue contrasting points of view on an ethical subject related to dress.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students apply knowledge from multiple sources through class discussions, in-class essays, exams, and in a research paper and an oral presentation.  In a final project, students collect scholarly evidence concerning an ethical issue related to fashion and dress, and present this evidence along with contrasting points of view concerning the issue.  For example, a student researching the corset may research the ethics of body reshaping/reforming in the 19th century, and debate the accuracies and inaccuracies of propaganda and reporting regarding its effect on women’s health during the Victorian era.  In reflective essays, students are asked to assess the status quo versus individual choices in fashion and dress for each period.</p>
<p><strong>IS-1:</strong> In this class, students will investigate and analyze the fashions of each time period and the status and economic markers in relation to both the individual and the collective society. For example, using documentary images, the shirtwaist, the ubiquitous women’s shirt of the early 20th century, is addressed sociologically and economically in order to assess women’s class membership and workers issues. The garment is considered in relation to working women’s positions and the development of Unions via examination of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire of 1912.  This is followed by examination of a variety of shirtwaists from the Queens College Costume Collection. The structural qualities inherent in the garment that imposed the socially accepted silhouette for each class are investigated, as is how women were able to function in them relative to their social position.  Students assess the range of textiles, supports, and detailing that signifies each shirtwaist’s cost, to understand economic realities across social classes, and the intrinsic impact these garments have as objects in themselves.</p>
<p><strong>IS-2:</strong> For each period, significant personal and collective clothing choices and their impact on the individual are explored. For example, the Zoot suit is examined as adopted by Hispanic and African American youth cultures during World War II. The complexities of personal style choices as individual expression are investigated to address how those choices functioned to foster group membership. This group identification is assessed, and how the adoption of the Zoot suit flew in the face of wartime clothing restrictions, to evaluate the subsequent backlash and racism by returning G.I.’s , which resulted in the Zoot suit riots.</p>
<p><strong>IS-3:</strong> Myriad ethical issues surrounding fashion will be addressed by students in this course including women’s rights, minority rights, sweat shops, animal rights, sustainability, and environmental concerns regarding fashion production.  In addition, each student is required to research a topic in depth relating to an ethical issue concerning fashion and to address its history with contrasting arguments.</p>
<p><strong>IS-4:</strong> Omitted</p>
<p><strong>IS-5:</strong> Students will be exploring how fashion necessitates the dress trends of local, national, and global cultures.  For example, the cyclical cultural interest in the ancient classical world is examined in the early twentieth century via the dancer Isadora Duncan’s costumes and Mariano Fortuny’s Delphos gowns, and the social significance for a woman wearing this artistic dress vs. the dress of mainstream Belle Epoque society. The Queens College Costume Collection is used by students throughout the semester to examine examples of textiles and garments from local makers and designers to contrast them with international ones;  and original Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Indian garments and textiles, to investigate cross cultural design exchanges between Eastern and Western cultures.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-1:</strong> This course satisfies a requirement in the Family and Consumer Sciences major for the Fashion and Textiles Specialization within the Family, Nutrition, and Exercise Sciences department.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-2:</strong> This course is not cross-listed with any other courses.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-3:</strong> This course is offered every spring semester with an expected enrollment of 25 students.  The room used to teach this course is adjacent to the Queens College Costume Collection, where students will be able to analyze and research historic costumes throughout the time periods being studied.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives CV Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives CV Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students examine views and opinions of past events at different points of history, so in this sense, the “variety” in this course is at least partially temporal, such as views of South African apartheid before Truth Commissions, and views after them.  Moreover, the course compares strategies of commemoration and indoctrination in multiple nations and multiple contexts.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Memories of significant events change over time, and are deployed in keeping with particular, context-specific agendas.  As students come to see how this phenomenon occurs, we discuss what exactly “evidence” is, when it is able to be manipulated.  Students learn to read with critical perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> The course requires extensive amounts of writing, including six 3-4 page analytical papers; midterm essays; and a longer 15-page paper.  The assignments pose questions that compel original thought, such as, for example, after students dealt with an early phase of Truth Commissions in South Africa, they are asked to consider an essay by Desmond Tutu, and discuss how it contributes to or alters the outcome before it.</p>
<p><strong>IS-1:</strong> The sources encountered in this course range from UN reports, to film, to personal narratives, and so on.  In evaluating these, students apply historical methods that take into consideration audience, bias, the state and nature of archival records, and social relations.  This course also involves students in story collection, and thus exposes them directly to the craft of the public historian.</p>
<p><strong>IS-2:</strong> The course looks at how crucial events are perceived differently by various categories of society.  Identity is fluid and is contingent on context.  Students will discover this both in essays on historical phenomena and through experiential exercises involving surveying and interviews of peers with respect to their encounters with historical memory.</p>
<p><strong>IS-3:</strong> Memory of the past involves issues that are at the core of identity, such as patriotism, ethnicity, notions of difference, and even one’s place in time.  The class readings and discussions reveal the fluidity of ethics over time and in a variety of historical contexts.</p>
<p><strong>IS-4:</strong> Memory is documented in a host of ways, from monuments to mythologies.  In the case of the sample syllabus on truth commissions, students encounter documents purporting to explore “truth”, such as UN reports or documentary films.  These present “data” that are subject to embrace or debate; even something as concrete as “data”, students learn, may change over time.</p>
<p><strong>IS-5:</strong> Large groups of people are complicit in creating and sharing historical memory, just as large groups my contest conventional views.  This course observes but one step in the very formation of collectives – the creation of historical memory – and interrogates its origins.  For example, UN reports in the sample syllabus, about which students must write essays, show how an international institution may interpose itself in local controversies.</p>

<h3 id="ISHIST255">HIST 255 <span class="inactive">Currently Inactive</span></h3><h4>Approved 2013-04-16</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> In this course, students consult a variety of primary sources that originate from different “sides” in the Arab/Israeli conflict, and those “sides” both poles, plus outside negotiators like the UN and the US.  So, sources include documentary film, UN reports, editorials, position papers, diplomatic proposals, and maps.  Most important is the breadth of perspectives that are considered — Arab, Israeli, US, and UN, but then, within those, also elite vs. non-elite, religious vs. secular, and native vs. diaspora.  Students write papers that consider all sides.  This course also involves experiential, simulative components that further immerse students in how knowledge is created — by hazarding different perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Groups of varying ethnicities and religions and political outlooks have obviously clashed in our society for millennia and will continue to do so.  This course offers a laboratory, of sorts, for working through issues along these lines in a controlled setting with clear problems and objectives.  Students must express themselves in this course both in writing and in oral presentation, and critical research is necessary for both of the above.  In this sense, the course contributes to a well rounded education, while also exposing students to key issues in a volatile part of the world.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students are specifically asked to consider historical narratives of, and approaches to, conflict from a variety of texts written by both Israeli and Palestinian scholars and negotiators across the political continuum, the diaspora in the US, and the US government.  For just one example, one session includes a comparison of the Clinton Parameter and the Beirut Declaration.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> The simulative, experiential exercises in this introductory class force students to take different perspectives on the same issue, which requires close analysis and criticism of primary sources.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> With the take-home midterm and final; the essay assignment, “The narrative of the other”; and the position briefs in the simulative exercises, students have multiple opportunities to hone their writing skills. In “The narrative of the other” students analyze the Arab/Palestinian and Israeli conflict from the breakup of the Ottoman Empire to Camp David II using primary source documents, and discuss how ethnic and religious categories have affected individual experiences of events and society.

Present oral arguments to their peers, “fellow negotiators”, which represent the negotiating positions of the characters they are playing in the simulation.</p>
<p><strong>IS-1:</strong> This introductory course takes an historical approach to exploring various forms of identity in the Arab/Israeli conflict – ethnic, religious, socio-economic, and national.  Primary source documents elucidate perspectives of Israelis, Palestinians, diaspora communities, and US government officials involved in events.</p>
<p><strong>IS-2:</strong> In numerous class discussions, as well as in “The narrative of the other” assignment described above, we investigate how one’s decisions in dealing with conflict are informed by background and category.  A principal goal of the simulative exercise is to encourage the students themselves to step out of their own perspective, so that those who might be expected to sympathize with Israeli positions, must produce briefs from Palestinian perspectives, and so on. The course shows how the negotiator that the student is representing may be seen as a product of his/her experience in society.</p>
<p><strong>IS-3:</strong> The principal objective of the exercise described above, where students shift perspectives in taking on roles in thie conflict, is to challenge notions of “right” and “wrong” and instead see how positions are taken, and considered to be ethical.</p>
<p><strong>IS-4:</strong> One part of the course looks at how the media and other forms of communication can be used to incite violence or to foster dialogue, depending on audience of the text, or the bias of the author.  We also consider the political significance of map making as a source of knowledge and ideology.  This is particularly evident in discussions of Egyptian Demilitarized Zones, the Clinton Parameters, or the Olmert Map, to name a few.</p>
<p><strong>IS-5:</strong> Local and national ideologies are certainly in evidence, and when we discuss the role of US negotiators in the conflict, a global component is introduced.  In every case, we consider a variety of collectives, and we consider them through individual simulations.  Students thus acquire insight into how “group think” evolves; what makes it strong and what might alter it.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives SS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives SS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> HNRS 226 is taught by faculty from Urban Studies, Sociology, or Political Science. Students draw on a variety of sources including ecological studies, urban policy documents, historical analyses of infrastructure development, environmental impact statements, transportation studies, and reports from grassroots organizations. These sources enable students to analyze a range of formal and informal institutions engaged in planning and policy-making in New York City. Students learn to interpret and assess how the interplay of social, economic, and political forces shape the experiences and expectations of individuals as participants within policy-making processes in New York City.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> The course addresses major historical and current events on a planning or policy issue to understand how policy decisions are made, and the roles that individuals take, or are given, in governmental decision-making processes. Throughout the semester, students engage in a team research project in which they study how institutional agents of change in the city—federal, state, and city government, public authorities, private sector interests, community boards, and community-based organizations—participate in policy-making. For example, team projects may focus on the production of space in New York City, such as the implementation of the Grid Plan, the creation of Central Park, and the redevelopment of Times Square. Through these projects, students engage the roles that individuals play in decision-making, and the ways in which these roles are affected by patterns of inequality and the operation of power.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students are required to participate in a team project on a current policy issue which they present in class and at a student conference at the end of the semester. Students choose from among a number of important urban issues. For example, (i) current real estate development and its impacts on New York City residents; (ii) systems of waste disposal and their impacts on communities and individuals; (iii) infrastructures, transportation systems, and issues pertaining to quality of life; and (iv) resource allocations for parks, public spaces, and other urban amenities. Team projects require that students learn how to prepare well-reasoned arguments using evidence from a variety of source documents (listed above) to support their conclusions. Students also write a final paper based on significant primary and secondary research in which they present evidence and arguments concerning the power dynamics between individuals and society within governmental decision-making processes.</p>
<p><strong>IS-1:</strong> This course is interdisciplinary; students are introduced to concepts and theoretical perspectives from various scholarly disciplines including, Urban Studies, Sociology, and Political Science. Students use primary sources, both qualitative and quantitative, in their team projects, presentations, and final research papers. For example, students are introduced to the social, cultural, and historical contexts for themes of inequality and community participation on pressing issues of concern for New York City. Readings cover important historical moments in social policy formation, such as the fiscal crisis of the 1970s, welfare reform, and the formation of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, and their impact on neighborhoods and individuals. Students identify and apply historical knowledge, explore public policy steps taken to address these issues, integrate material from source documents (listed above) and formulate solutions about how best to handle these problems in the future</p>
<p><strong>IS-2:</strong> This course is designed to help students understand how an individual’s place in society shapes their experiences, values, and choices.  Individual values explored in the course include those based on race, class, gender, and larger patterns of inequality. For example, course assignments are designed to help students understand the ways that wealthy elites and working class individuals frame and assess issues differently within policy debates. Such debates include, for example, proposed real estate development or City Council action to allocate public space or other urban amenities. Course assignments ask students to reflect on the extent to which an individual can influence policy decisions affecting the city, specifically, its people, built environment, and institutions.</p>
<p><strong>IS-3:</strong> The course requires that students develop the ability to articulate and assess the ethics of the public policy process. In particular, students are encouraged to think about the ways that social inequalities are reflected in the decisions that policy makers often make. Course assignments require students to understand and assess the underlying premises of arguments presented by stakeholders including, governmental actors, community-based organizations, urban planners, and other interests. Students are asked to reflect on patterns of social inequality as they impact the ethics of public policy decision-making, and the dynamics of interest convergence and opposition. These assignments are geared to getting students to understand and assess policy decisions as they are shaped by power differentials inherent in New York City.</p>

<h3 id="ISHSS200">HSS 200 Social Sciences and Society [IS]</h3><h4>Approved 2012-12-26</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives SS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives SS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> The reading assignments for HSS 200 ask students to analyze information from a number of sources and points of view.  For instance, for an interdisciplinary unit on “Pregnancy and Childbirth,” students might read a historical treatment of the medicalization of childbirth in the United States; an anthropological analysis of the use of ultrasound equipment in contemporary Greece; and a philosopher’s discussion of the ethics of becoming a parent.  Prior to class, students share discussion questions.  They are encouraged to ask questions that do not merely seek information, but rather that identify similarities and differences of interpretation and methodology across disciplines.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Students in HSS 200 learn to place the development of major disciplinary paradigms, schools of thought, and scholarly debates in their wider social and political contexts.  These connections become most clear in the main paper assignment for the course, in which students write about a debate or controversy within the social sciences.  To complete this assignment successfully, students cannot merely report about a debate (ie. outline two sides).  Rather, they must think much more broadly.  A student interested in sociological debates about the efficacy of welfare reform in the United States, for example, will explore the history of welfare policy in America, the political and judicial climate that brought about the reform, why and how sociologists have become invested in the debate, their varying methods for studying the reform’s efficacy, and their efforts to present these conclusions to the broadest possible audience.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> For the aforementioned paper assignment, students produce an account (6-8 page draft and a 10-12 page final paper) in which they historicize and analyze a major social scientific controversy or debate. They additionally give an oral presentation related to their research paper.  Throughout the process of writing the paper and preparing the presentation, students engage in a dialogue with the professor and with one another about the strengths and weaknesses of their evidence, analysis, and conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>IS-1:</strong> HSS 200 provides students with a critical introduction to social scientific knowledge production, emphasizing the diversity of approaches through which social scientists in the academy today study “individuals,” “society,” and the relationship between the two.  Helping students learn to compare and to contrast this process in different social scientific disciplines is a key goal of the course. 

HSS 200 additionally places the development of major disciplinary paradigms, schools of thought, and scholarly debates in their wider social and political contexts.  By focusing not only on the methods, but also on the politics of academic knowledge production, the course demonstrates to students how the academy (disciplines and academics within them) is linked to society at large.</p>
<p><strong>IS-2:</strong> HSS 200 deals directly with questions of diversity and difference, placing them at the center of an analysis of the production and reproduction of social scientific knowledge. This means that students are asked to question notions of “society” as a monolithic place and to think about the inclusion and exclusion of different groups and individuals from social scientific study.

Furthermore, this course places the social scientist on center stage.  Students learn about the individuals who developed the different disciplines and how their backgrounds and philosophies influenced individual careers (what and how they studied) and the evolution of their fields.  In a series of guest lectures by Queens College professors from throughout the social sciences, students learn about their professors’ career trajectories and read their original research. In reaction papers, students then discuss questions such as: What aspects of the social world does the guest speaker investigate? How does he or she do it? and What do you find unique or interesting about his or her approach? As the semester progresses, the papers compare a speaker’s frameworks, methods and sources of “data” to that of other speakers.</p>
<p><strong>IS-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IS-4:</strong> HSS 200 addresses the ways that power dynamics, structural and institutional forces, and cultural systems shape the creation of social scientific research plans and agendas. The readings and discussions pay careful attention to the problems, limitations, and ongoing need to rethink various paradigms for analyzing what “society” is and how individuals within it should be studied.  More concretely, the readings and guest lectures often focus on the ethical implications and best practices of working with human subjects.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> A primary task of philosophy, practically identical with the Socratic method, is to distinguish knowledge from opinion, or what we are justified in believing from what we merely wish were true. Criticism of arguments is therefore central.

Tracing the disagreements among philosophers requires constant evaluation of arguments, counter-arguments, objections, rebuttals; and continual concern for clarity. These dimensions of assessment apply to student activities and assignments throughout the course: class discussion, oral presentations, and written assignments, including critical, analytical, and argumentative  essays in examinations.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> In all sections of Philosophy 101, the Department requires both short (3-5 pp.) and long (8-10 pp.) papers that include a thesis statement, a defense of the thesis against objections, arguments in support of the thesis, and a conclusion. Midterm and final examinations must include argumentative essays that require students to produce arguments advancing an answer to a philosophical question and turning aside objections to it. Questions about the adequacy of arguments endorsed by great philosophers require that these arguments be restated and assessed, objections advanced, counter-arguments considered, etc. In class discussions too, well-reasoned arguments are of great importance; opinions must be supported.</p>
<p><strong>IS-1:</strong> The methods of philosophy include analysis of concepts and the tracing of conceptual connections; attention to confusions of meaning or scope; criticism of arguments in terms of validity, soundness, and strength; weighing of rival considerations; consideration of objections, and counters to them. In discussion and in oral and written assignments, students apply these methods to philosophical questions. Every section of PHIL 101 includes part on moral and political philosophy, in which the relation between the individual and society is explored.</p>
<p><strong>IS-2:</strong> Rival accounts of the source of moral obligation give rise to different values and choices. In applied ethics, challenges such as capital punishment, euthanasia, identity politics, or genetic engineering are examined in the light of various approaches, eg., consequentialist, deontological, virtue-based. Depending on the topic, the social element is either to the fore or in the background. Exposure to varied moral outlooks highlights the plastic nature of moral intuition. Examination of the relation between religion and morality also addresses questions concerning the origin of individual and social good.</p>
<p><strong>IS-3:</strong> One important element in any introductory philosophy course is a segment dealing with ethics, outlining the broad divisions among major ethical views and examining the underpinnings of these views (if they have them: Moore’s moral intuitionism explicitly states that intuitions are not based on premises of any kind). Students are assessed on their grasp of these topics in class discussions, reflection papers, research papers, and in essays written in examinations.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Readings from great philosophers introduce students to different intellectual traditions and outlooks. Philosophy encourages communication and conversation across these differences. In becoming aware of the complexity and diversity of human thinking, and its deep and varied history, students are given a background against which to assess their own thinking and that of their peers. In courses in ethics, the question of relativism is raised: is there any moral truth that is true always and everywhere, or are moral truths always relative to norms that change across time and place?</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> A primary task of philosophy, practically identical with the Socratic method, is to distinguish knowledge from opinion, or what we are justified in believing from what we merely wish was true. Criticism of arguments is central.

Questions about the adequacy of arguments endorsed by great philosophers require that these arguments be restated and assessed, objections advanced, counter-arguments considered, etc. In class discussions too, well-reasoned arguments are of great importance; opinions must be supported.</p>
<p><strong>IS-1:</strong> The methods of ethics are those of philosophy in general: analysis of concepts and the tracing of conceptual connections; attention to confusions of meaning or scope; criticism of arguments in terms of validity; weighing of rival considerations; consideration of objections, and counters to them. In ethics, a large role is also played by appeals to moral intuition, usually through the device of examples. In discussion and in oral and written assignments, students apply these methods to questions about what makes an individual life a good life, and how each good life relates to the lives of others. Many moral quandaries involve choosing between lesser and greater evils, weighing the interests of the one against that of the many, or pitting one individual against another.</p>
<p><strong>IS-2:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IS-3:</strong> Every reading, activity, and assignment in the course is directed towards this outcome: ethical views and their underlying premises are the primary content of most of the readings; lectures and class discussion address the adequacy of these intellectual underpinnings; in class discussion and in written assignments students analyze the claims of rival ethical views and subject them to critical evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>IS-4:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IS-5:</strong> Every section of PHIL 104 covers both pure and applied ethics. Moral quandaries such as abortion and infanticide, euthanasia, punishment, suicide, torture, etc., are examined, and the adequacy of various ethical responses to these quandaries assessed. In some sections, students are asked to produce a case study of an ethical dilemma; in others they may defend one side of a question in class, while other students defend another. Because these moral questions are concrete, they often form the basis for group discussion as well as topics for written assignments.</p>

<p><strong>IS-1:</strong> The methods of philosophy include analysis of concepts and the tracing of conceptual connections; attention to distinctions and confusions of meaning or scope; criticism of arguments in terms of validity; weighing of rival considerations; consideration of objections, and counters to them, etc. In discussion and in oral and written assignments, students apply these methods to questions about religious practices, attitudes, and beliefs. What are the relative roles of faith, reason, tradition, authority, and society in religion? Does morality require religious underpinning? How far does religious freedom extend?</p>
<p><strong>IS-2:</strong> Religious pluralism influences discussions in every area of the philosophy of religion. Differences between the ’Abrahamic’ faiths can quite often be ignored, but other religions have such different conceptions of reality that it is not clear the term ’religion’ can have any substantive meaning. Individual values often reflect religious values. In religiously pluralistic societies, individual values may determine choice of religion. In discussion and written assignments, student’s grasp of these complex connections is assessed.</p>
<p><strong>IS-3:</strong> The relation between religion and morality is a central topic in philosophy of religion, at issue in the Euthyphro dilemma, Abraham’s sacrifice of Isaac, Kierkegaard’s separation of the ethical from the religious, etc. Religions attribute value to reality and reality to values. Can non-religious standpoints do so too? The ability of students to understand, formulate, and defend ethical views is assessed in class discussions and written assignments, including essays in examinations.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> The required readings for the course represent a wide variety of different perspectives and points of view.  They include essays by social theorists, summaries of contemporary political science research, primary source documents, and writings by historians.  Lectures and class discussion focus on offering conflicting evaluations of different institutional arrangements like electoral systems and the separation of powers.  Students are also introduced to competing versions of normative concepts like democracy. Finally, our discussion of contemporary ideologies provides a framework for alternative interpretations of a wide array of social phenomena.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> A major portion of the course is devoted to analyzing competing points of view—on the nature and feasibility of democracy, on institutional arrangements like the electoral rules and the separation of powers, and on concrete policy issues, like health policy. An introduction to the basic logic of social science research also provides students with a powerful critical thinking tool.  Many of the lectures are organized in a format that emphasizes the strengths and weaknesses of different institutional arrangements and that juxtaposes competing theories.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students are required to write short critical essays on selected assigned readings.  The format of these papers asks students to distill the author’s argument into one or two sentences, then elaborate it and evaluate it.  Also, in-class essay exams require students to demonstrate command of competing arguments and to defend a point of view.  Both of these skills are modelled during in-class discussions that encourage students to formulate their points of view coherently and defensibly.</p>
<p><strong>IS-1:</strong> The overall theme of the course is that while political science may be intrinsically interesting to some people, its insights are important to everyone because of the way it connects individual experiences and goals to public policies and the application of political power.  I continually emphasize the importance of what I call a “political perspective” on social phenomena — our individual life chances are deeply influenced by politics.  This is especially explicit in the assignments by Mills and Bowman.  The course is organized around the factors that political scientists have identified as important determinants of policy: institutional rules, political resources, and ideology.  Finally, the course includes an introduction to political science research methods.</p>
<p><strong>IS-2:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IS-3:</strong> Ethical values figure prominently in three sections of the course.  Our discussion of democracy presents an overview of the main interpretations of the most fundamental norms in politics.  It connects different views of democracy to their historical setting as well as relating them to the perceived flaws of alternative views.  Our discussion of ideology does something similar, locating systems of values and beliefs in their historical context and applying them to contemporary issues like capital punishment.  Finally, our discussion of Martin Luther King Jr.’s defense of civil disobedience raises basic issues of justice and responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>IS-4:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IS-5:</strong> One topic of the course is the development of liberalism and individualism and their impact on US politics and society.  In our critique of contemporary democratic theory, we discuss political and economic trends that may magnify the political influence of business influence.  These include the weakening of campaign finance regulation, the decline of unions, the increased geographical mobility of business, and increasingly prevalent neoliberal ideology.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> The required readings for the course provide students with information from a variety of sources and points of view, ranging from ancient texts of ethics to a recent inaugural address by the current President of the United States. Class lectures highlight what Sheldon Wolin has called “the perennial conversation” among political theorists across time and place, emphasizing how different questions are raised as well as answered.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> This course trains students in how to read complex texts in a deeper way than simply the summary book report. Through weekly writing, students learn how to think, read and write critically by uncovering the central value motivating the author, the rhetorical methods she uses to persuade, as well as the apriori assumptions she makes about fundamental aspect of human nature, individually and collectively.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students are required to write weekly about their texts as well as write essays for their midterm and final exams. Since we spend time together evaluating the reasoning and evidence used by the canonical political thinkers we read, students develop the skills to bring such analytic rigor to their own writing.</p>
<p><strong>IS-1:</strong> As the syllabus states from the start the meta-theme of this course to is expose students to the classical readings engaging concepts central to political science – such as the nature of justice, human collectivity, the role of government and the purpose of law.</p>
<p><strong>IS-2:</strong> Throughout the semester, students are asked to think about who is included and who excluded, and why, from the various theoretical explorations of the purpose of politics in human life. We also spend time examining how a theorist’s argument is influenced by the perspective they adopt —- whether down in the street with the masses (Marx), away from the messy business of politics (Plato), or up from the ruler’s realm (Machiavelli).</p>
<p><strong>IS-3:</strong> In addition to reading Artistotle’s Nicomechean Ethics, where he argues that ethics is the prelude to politics and politics the fulfillment of ethics, we spend time over the course of the term examining the value structure animating the different thinkers.  For example, we consider the difference valuing the good of society as a whole over the good of individuals in the aggregate makes in a work of political theory. Likewise, we spend time exploring the varying views Aristotle, Machiavelli and Marx had on the role of morality in politics.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> The course manages an active discourse on various theoretical perspectives. Students read and discuss sociological theories. In addition to using a textbook, readings will include original writings of key thinkers and scholars in the discipline as well as journal articles on selected topics. During class discussion and in exams, students will use these various and sometimes conflicting theories to explain contemporary social problems.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Lectures model critical and analytical thinking by sifting through various sociological theories and evaluating logic and evidence. In exams and in written assignments, students will be asked to assess the fit between the theory and empirical evidence about various social problems. For example, one essay assignment requires students to use Durkheim and Weber’s theories of bureaucracy to analyze the poor outcomes resulting from the reorganization of the City of Baltimore, Agency for Child Protective Services.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> In both class discussions, writing assignments and exams, students will choose among sociological paradigms to explain social phenomena and will defend the applicability of their paradigms of choice.  For example, along with the assigned readings on racial and inequality, students will watch “Eyes on the Prize,” a documentary about the Civil Rights Movement. As part of the second exam, students will write a well-reasoned  argument that lays out the merits of Marx, Durkheim or Weber’s theories of social change as a framework for  explaining the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
<p><strong>IS-1:</strong> In Sociology 101: 
•	Students are exposed to a framework for understanding individual actions in the social context. 
•	Students learn the basic concepts, theories, themes, and methodology used in the discipline of sociology (e.g., anomie, alienation, symbolic interactionism, structural functionalism, conflict theory, social stratification and mobility, diversity, surveys, experiments, field research).
•	Students apply these theories, research methods and explanations to a wide range of topics, including social inequality, gender and family, race and ethnicity, the educational and health care system and aging.</p>
<p><strong>IS-2:</strong> This course describes the social structures that influence the formation of attitudes, experiences, and values that emanate from class, ethnicity, race, age, and gender.  Selected readings and film will be used to illustrate the relationship between these constructs and an individual’s experiences and identity as well as larger social movements. In writing assignments and class discussion, students will place individual life in the context of the larger social structure. For example, students will use the  healthcare readings as the basis for writing a memo about how an older relative experiences contemporary healthcare institutions and retirement options.</p>

<h3 id="ISSOC208">SOC 208 Social Problems [IS]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-04-16</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> The course investigates “social problems,” as a category embedded within economic, political and social structure. Students evaluate evidence from various perspectives to understand that social problems are not natural or inevitable, but created by social practices and ideas and institutional structures. The class explores how at the micro level, social problems are often considered to be the acts of individuals; yet at the macro level, social problems are generally informed by categorical inequality and the uneven distribution of power in society. Questions about how these structural elements cause social problems are asked throughout the course. Each Social Problems course uses a selected topic (s) to understand how sociological forces, e.g., income inequality, the distribution of power shape social problems. Through the use of original source material,  documentaries, class discussions, exams and guest speakers, students will engage in asking questions with various and sometimes contradictory answers to explain the emergence of social problems.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> The class focuses on the social construction of social problems drawing on readings from various disciplines: anthropology, economics and sociology. For example, to understand the failed U.S. policy in Afghanistan, students will read books written by policy makers, journalists and an ethnographic account of ethnic conflict and warfare (1979-1995) written by an ex-Taliban soldier during his years fighting against the Russians.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Sociology 208 uses a social structural perspective to explain how  a variety of social problems emerge.   Each Social Problems course uses a selected topic (s) to understand how sociological forces, e.g., income inequality, the distribution of power shape social problems. Through the use of original source material,  documentaries, class discussions, exams and guest speakers, students will engage various and sometimes contradictory information to explain the emergence of social problems.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> A variety of assignments require students to  evaluate the validity of  an arguments against empirical evidence. For example, to understand how the imbalance of political power embedded in the Afghan Constitution has contributed to  the deteriorating security, political and development  outcomes in Afghanistan,  students will read an ethnographic account of how ethnic conflict masks social stratification. Students will compare this reading with the counter arguments detailed in various newspaper accounts that promoted a centralized government—at the expense of  federalism.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Through class discussions, exams and writing assignments, students will analyze and synthesize the readings.   Additionally, students are required to demonstrate command of the readings by orally summarizing the key arguments described. For example, students will read a book by Donald Rumsfeld that details the history of U.S. policy in Afghanistan. In class discussions, students will evaluate the arguments that undergrided key policy decisions and compare these to the arguments against these policies made by journalists.</p>
<p><strong>IS-1:</strong> This course engages the fundamental concepts about status and power from the disciplines of sociology, political science and anthropology to explore the relationship between the individual and society. For example, one reading assignment illuminates the story of an individual who fought for a decade with the Taliban and describes the social conditions that influenced his decision to do so.</p>
<p><strong>IS-2:</strong> Students will examine the construction of social problems as these are defined by social class, the institution that defines the social problem, and access to political power. These constructs influence attitudes, experience and values. For example, in class discussion, students will be asked to explain how the Afghan Statistics Bureau contributed to justifying a skewed representation of the non-Pashtun ethnic groups in Afghanistan, and how this uneven political power contributes to fewer educational and employment opportunities to the non-Pashtun ethnic groups.</p>
<p><strong>IS-3:</strong> The underlying premises of ethical views are not neutral but defined by social class, ethnic and social stratification and power. Students will assess how these views shape the creation of institutions that, in turn, create and or limit opportunity.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> This course includes a variety of assigned material which exposes students to the variety of methods that social scientists use to study social phenomena and social institutions.  These materials demonstrate how the sociological approach uses research findings and historical analyses to understand the social factors that shape social institutions and current events. 
Reading materials and assignments are based on original research articles and primary sources that expose students to the variety of methods used to create knowledge and understanding in the social sciences.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Through the reading materials, assignments and classroom discussions, students learn how to use scientific research evidence to evaluate widely held explanations of the country’s educational ‘problems’ and popular educational proposals for school reform.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Two short written assignments provide students the opportunity to produce well-reasoned written arguments using evidence to support their conclusions.  
Examples of assignments:  Assignment 1:Identify an educational problem that has currently received national or state attention. Describe the problem and use available statistics to demonstrate its prevalence and what group of students is particularly affected by it.  Describe and provide pros and cons of any educational reforms that have been proposed to address this problem.  
Assignment 2: Select a school reform that is currently considered or already applied by various states or by the US federal government.  Described the reform and evaluate the commonly presented for, and, against arguments regarding this reform. 

For these assignments, students use a variety of national media sources— such as, NY Times, Education Week, Wall Street Journal, NCES, U.S. Department of Education Website— to select a topic and gather appropriate information. They use sociological knowledge from class readings and classroom discussions as well as evidence from peer-reviewed published articles to write their evaluations.</p>
<p><strong>IS-1:</strong> This course develops a sociological and historical analysis of the role and function of the institution of education in American society.  It examines the broad social, economic, and political forces that shape the institution of education, its structure and function in the U.S.  Students are exposed to different methods of research and analysis in the social sciences by reading primary sources, such as original theoretical and research works that shaped the foundations of the field of Sociology of Education and research following various theoretical and methodological approaches to  analyze current educational conditions, policies and student outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>IS-2:</strong> The second section of the course consists of readings that examine the working conditions and experiences of teachers and the educational experiences of students.  Emphasis is placed on the social factors that affect individual’s working conditions and opportunities for advancement within the educational system and students’ access and success in education.  Special focus is placed on how students’ social positions affect their educational experiences and the development of their aspirations and choices.  It examines differences in the educational experiences and learning opportunities of students according to their gender, race, ethnicity and social class backgrounds.  Students read original research work and statistical evidence pertaining to race/ethnic, gender and social class differences in the educational performance, educational opportunities and educational orientations of students.</p>

<p><strong>IS-5:</strong> A significant section of the course is devoted to an overview and critical analysis of competing ideologies regarding the role of education for society and individuals’ well-being and the resulting educational developments, policies and reforms.  A historical overview examines the various competing ideologies that shaped the foundations of the U.S. educational system and concludes with an overview and critical analysis of current educational developments, policies and reforms. (such as efforts for school privatization through private school vouchers and charter schools and efforts for school accountability through the  “No Child Left Behind” legislation).

<h3 id="ISURBST114">URBST 114 Sex and the City [IS]</h3><h4>Approved 2015-12-11</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Urbst 114 draws on the multidisciplinary fields of urban studies, sexuality studies and gender studies, positioning them within the wider disciplinary landscape of the social sciences, and comparing how social scientific knowledge about cities and sexuality is produced from a variety of disciplinary perspectives. The course emphasis is two-fold: the history of sexuality in cities of the world, and the theories and method in the social sciences that have been used to excavate, analyze and account for the emergence of different kinds of sexual desire, identity and community in different urban contexts. Students are exposed to basic urban research methods such as fieldwork, survey research, census data analysis, and historical analysis, and begin the process of learning to critically analyze the treatment of sexuality by social scientists.  The fields of inquiry are introduced to the students in the first week (see syllabus) and are then reinforced through assignments as the semester proceeds.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Given the diverse character of our college and of our student body, this course addresses important themes that should be an essential part of Queens College’s and CUNY’s general education curriculum. It contributes to the liberal arts curriculum by showing the historical and contemporary importance of sexual and gender politics and sexuality communities to society and by exploring controversies about sexuality, gender and urban life today. Because it focuses on the connection of urban and sexual politics, the course exposes students to a large number of social scientific themes and a wide variety of experiences and viewpoints, including those of the students themselves, who often need help in making sense of their own experiences and of the experiences of others with whom they interact on a daily basis. As the syllabus indicates, the inter-disciplinary perspective represented here is first introduced in the first week of the course. The course then proceeds with reading material from a variety of disciplines, from geography to anthropology, from history to political science.  These differences will be emphasized as each reading is introduced.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students will learn to gather, interpret and assess information from a variety of sources and points of view by reading scholarly articles, book chapters, popular media, and blogs and by discussing them in class. Readings and in-class discussion highlight different points of view, major scholarly debates, research traditions, and public debates, contrasting the writings of scholars in sexuality and urban studies with those of political activists, journalists, fiction writers, and others to illustrate competing perspectives on the construction of sexual identity and about sexual and gender politics in different historical and geographical contexts.  Reading material also exposes students to data collection and analysis using a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods, including historical research, ethnographic inquiry, GIS, demographic research, case studies, and media studies.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Students read scholarly work and case studies that exemplify techniques of critical analysis.  As a major part of this course, students will contrast this work with that from popular cultural sources.  One purpose of this is for students to learn to distinguish scholarly arguments and evidence from those that circulate in the mass media and elsewhere.  Another is to compare different kinds of social science research from survey research, geography, ethnographic research, historical studies and case studies. Through class discussion and writing assignments, students will learn to understand competing arguments, evaluate the evidence on which they are based, and identify their strengths and weaknesses.  For example, students may be asked to engage in a critical assessment of past social and natural scientific studies about the nature of homosexuality and its role in society (e.g., sociobiology) and how misconceptions and faulty methodologies by past experts has been used to justify and legitimate prejudice and discriminatory views and practices.   Students will also learn to evaluate the merits of diversity, assimilation, and multiculturalism paradigms, and debates over the biological or social basis for sexual and gender differences by reading about these theories and debates, by writing about them in homework assignments and in exams, and by discussing them in class.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Through a combination of different kinds of graded activities (reading response papers, analytical thought pieces, midterm exams and final exams), students learn to synthesize evidence from reading, lectures, and class discussion, and to produce well-reasoned and well-supported arguments based on evidence from a variety of scholarly sources.  For example, (a) in a homework assignment, students may be asked to evaluate the way sexuality is described in films such as “Cabaret,” based on a scholarly account of sexual subcultures of the Weimar Republic; (b) construct their own argument in a response paper or exam question about how race and class intersect with sexuality and gender, drawing on scholarly work; (c) produce their own historical account of the rise of various sexual and gender minority movements, from LGBT rights to the asexual rights movement, based on reading material; and (d) construct an argument for or against public sex or sexting, in a response paper or exam question.</p>
<p><strong>IS-1:</strong> This course is interdisciplinary.  Students learn concepts and theoretical perspectives from various disciplines, including urban studies, anthropology, sociology, sexuality studies, and history.  The concepts of sexuality, gender and cities are used to explore the relationship of the individual to society.  Sexuality Studies and and Urban Studies are fields that have pioneered the study of how modern individuals see themselves and relate to others culturally, politically and economically.  From the late 19th century on, social scientists who have studied cities have been interested in the shift from traditional forms of community and social organization to more complex ones, rooted in the emerging sense of the free individual whose links to others are established via their shared values, habits, work lives, identities and voluntary affiliations.  From this perspective, the city is typically viewed as a major location where the modern individual cultivates his or her sense of self, where new, modern social norms are established, and where new problems and dilemmas such as alienation, disorganization, complexity, and heterogeneity also emerge.  The Chicago School of Sociology, in the early 20th century, began to ask questions about individuality, sexual norms, subcultures and communities in modern urban areas in the United States.  In subsequent decades, scholars extended the analytical lens to cities beyond the United States and to social situations in which different intellectual and popular traditions around the rights of the individual viz the society at large are in place.  In the first weeks of the course, students are introduced to this intellectual trajectory: They trace the roots of the sociological and historical study of sexuality to Chicago School urban studies and then go beyond to the rise of lesbian/gay studies in the 1970s and to global queer studies in the 1990s.  In subsequent weeks, the course focuses on the ways that interdisciplinary approaches exploring the individual and collective expression of desire balance with or against social norms, and the mediating institutions through which individuals gain a sense of their sexual and gendered selves in relation to that of others and of the society as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>IS-2:</strong> Students learn to understand and assess various public policy, political and popular positions on sex and gender in the US and elsewhere, and they learn the ways these positions affect the experiences, values and choices of sexual and gender minorities.  Additional attention is given to the ways that race and class and other axes of difference and inequality shape individual experiences, values and choices.  Assignments, reading material and exams are designed to help students to locate different sexual subcultures and communities in the urban landscape, to understand how individuals in these communities frame and assess issues affecting them, how social norms, values, and practices change over time, and the role of collective struggle, and of individual experiences of oppression and resistance, in reshaping norms and values.  Assignments also may ask students to reflect on the role of individuals in various movements, from the struggle for LGBT rights and to those who oppose gay marriage for religious or other reasons, asking what may motivate them, how they may understand inequality and difference, and how they navigate unequal power relations in their daily lives.</p>
<p><strong>IS-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IS-4:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>IS-5:</strong> Through the analysis of case studies from various locales, in different historical periods, and at different scales (local, national and global), students learn to identity and engage in debates over shifting sex and gender norms and politics, the ways new forms of urbanizing inequality affect sexual minorities, and the forms of collective struggle for sexual minority rights and recognition that have emerged in recent decades.  Students will also examine political, economic, and cultural factors that shape individual lifestyle choices (e.g., coming out of the closet, marriage, raising children, and online activity) in different places and at different times.  They will also analyze the social, political and economic consequences of those decisions.  Case studies are from inside and outside of the United States. Students may also learn to critically assess the global gay rights campaign, or similar efforts, exploring its promises and perils in different local and national contexts. They may also learn, for example, about the importance of colonialism in shaping the experiences of sexual minorities in places like Nigeria and about the individual and collective survival strategies for sexual minorities in Brazil and Mexico.</p>

<p><strong>QC-2:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives NS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students will learn to gather, interpret, and assess information from a variety of sources by participating in activities and completing assignments that involve solving genetics problems, participating in simulations of evolution, watching and discussing video footage of interviews with a wide array of biological anthropologists with contrasting views, observing primate behavior either in a zoo or on film, and examining and discussing fossil casts.  In large classes, active inquiry will be facilitated by dividing the class into smaller groups so that students can work together.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> This learning goal is achieved as students compare and critically evaluate knowledge about human evolution as generated by different approaches and according to the perspectives of related disciplines: molecular biology, geology, and primatology. The course relates human anatomy, ecology, and behavior to those characteristics in other mammals, with particular emphasis on differing groups of nonhuman primates. Furthermore, human anatomy and behavior are compared to what we know of those characteristics among extinct humans. In discussing human biological variation, the genetic, developmental, and behavioral adaptations of human populations residing in tropical forests, deserts, arctic environments, temperate climates, and high altitudes are compared and contrasted.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Through intensive in-class instruction on the scientific method as a whole, the structure and language of a scientific research paper, scientific argument, and the use of library and database searches, students will learn to produce well-reasoned written and oral arguments and use evidence to support their conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>SW-1:</strong> This course introduces students to the scientific method and its role in developing our understanding of how evolution has shaped our species and produced biological variation among modern humans. This course applies fundamental concepts of evolutionary biology, molecular genetics, behavioral ecology, and geology to construction and testing of research hypotheses, experimental design, and data analysis. The course also introduces students to the core methods used in the investigation of human evolution, including analysis of the fossil record, relative and absolute dating, molecular systematics, cladistics, and ethology.</p>
<p><strong>SW-2:</strong> This course demonstrates how quantitative approaches and formal analysis are used in solving problems on Mendelian and population genetics, absolute dating, systematics, and ethology.</p>
<p><strong>SW-3:</strong> This course examines the empirical evidence for the scientific theory of biological evolution including genetic and phenotypic variation within the human species and among non-human primates, the fossil record, and primate comparative morphology and behavior.</p>
<p><strong>SW-4:</strong> This course includes discussion of the impact of technological development and human population growth on primate habitats and primate diversity. Particular attention is given to conservation of endangered mammalian (primate) species.</p>
<p><strong>SW-5:</strong> In this course, students achieve a greater understanding of the scientific principles underlying matters of policy and public concern through discussion of how population structure, sociality, reproductive strategies, and ecology of different primate species determine specific policies and measures for their conservation. Also discussed is the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) and similar policies accepted in countries outside of US in relation to scientific research on human origins and the peopling of North America.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Previously approved for the Perspectives SS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Previously approved for the Perspectives SS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Introduction of Archaeology begins with an examination of how human evolution transformed the human ability to interact with the environment and each other as social beings. We evaluate the physical evidence of human evolution and consider evolution from a number of different scientific perspectives. The course then considers the physical evidence for number of phenomena such as domestication, agricultural intensification, population growth, urbanization, warfare, writing systems, and so on, which were independently developed in a number of areas of the world. We consider these various developments from the perspective of a number of theorists in order to better understand how humans adapt to their world as well as the development of social complexity.  Students also begin to understand how the same physical evidence can be interpreted differently depending upon the theoretical focus of the researcher.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Students in the course consider the strengths and weaknesses of the interpretations of archaeological remains based upon a number of issues such as preservation, discard, disturbance, etc. We consider how chronologies are constructed and the strengths and weaknesses of various dating methods. We also consider issues such as sampling and data collection and the limitation of certain methods.  We briefly touch upon the operationalization of particular concepts and how the way that we define and measure a particular concept can have an effect upon the results. For example, the way that a researcher defines “social complexity” will impact the emphasis of particular dimensions of the concept and in turn, the data the researcher will collect in order to test their hypothesis.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Through intensive in-class instruction on the scientific method as a whole, the structure and language of a scientific research paper, scientific argument, and the use of library and database searches, students will learn to produce well-reasoned written and oral arguments and use evidence to support their conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>SW-1:</strong> Students in Anthropology 103 are introduced to the elements of archaeological fieldwork, including excavation, survey, and laboratory techniques, that produce the data we use, and then consider how those data are used to reconstruct cultural chronologies, reconstruct past life ways, and explain cultural processes. In addition, we examine how, in the process of transforming their environments, humans have transformed themselves. Developments such as plant and animal domestication, population growth, sedentary life, environmental modification, urbanism, trade, social inequality, warfare, record-keeping systems and so on are interrelated and the interactions between these various phenomena have transformed human societies.</p>
<p><strong>SW-2:</strong> Students are introduced to archaeological field and laboratory methods and how these methods are used to construct cultural chronologies and reconstruct past behaviors. For example, we investigate how stratigraphic and stylistic dating methods are supplemented with absolute dating methods such as radiocarbon dating in order to fully understand the transformations that occurred in an archaeological site over time. Students also consider how data is collected from archaeological sites and analyzed using scientific techniques in order to discern how we reconstruct aspects of human life such as diet, domestication, social organization, social interaction, violence, ritual practices, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>SW-3:</strong> As noted above, in the written assignments, students in Anthropology 103 are asked to evaluate how material culture can be used to construct an argument.  In some assignments, they evaluate journal articles and critique the connection between the data and the interpretation. In lectures and readings students learn the strengths and weaknesses of particular lines of data and analytical methods and how theories once accepted are no longer considered valid both because of changes in archaeological and anthropological theory, and advancements in scientific techniques applied to archaeological data.</p>
<p><strong>SW-4:</strong> Anthropology 103 evaluates the role of cultural heritage in the modern world.  Students consider how archaeological sites and other historical places can be involved in modern politics. They also learn about interactions between archaeologists and indigenous groups, such as Native Americans, and how it is the responsibility of the researcher to consider the concerns of these groups and consider how archaeological interpretations might affect them. We also consider the importance of including a diversity of people and perspectives in the interpretive process.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> As students study the development of different astronomy models they will experience first-hand how such models and hypotheses reflected the attitudes and perceptions of different eras.  An important change occurred when Kepler actually plotted the data of Tycho Brahe to show that planet orbits were ellipses rather than presumed circles.  The ascendency of experimental data for the testing of scientific theories and hypotheses ever since was essentially the development of modern science.  The lectures, textbook, and homework assignments using online Mastering Astronomy problems present a series of changing points of view.   Students can also then appreciate that their own attitudes toward the solar system, galaxy, and universe have been conditioned by their exposure to science advancements of the recent decades.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Students are encouraged to active learning through online Mastering Astronomy homework assignments, tutorials and simulations that demonstrate astronomy principles; to viewing astronomy podcasts and exploring professional space study sites by agencies such as NASA.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Student assignments require them to use evidence based on experimental observations and astronomy models based on those observation to support conclusions about astronomical concepts for each section of the course.  The in class tests as well as the Mastering Astronomy assignments all require written answers based on scientific models and calculations.</p>
<p><strong>SW-1:</strong> Throughout this course it is shown how experimental evidence has shaped and changed our views of the physical world.  A prime example that first showed the primacy of physical data was when Kepler plotted the data collected and tabulated by Tycho Brahe over about a 3 decade period to show that the true shape of the planetary orbits were ellipses and not circles as previously always assumed.  Newton made a tremendous advance when he applied the same physical laws that could be tested here on earth to the moon, sun, and surrounding stars and then made predictions that could be tested by observations.  Applications of Newton’s laws made the industrial revolution possible.  Numerous examples abound throughout the course.  Our very use of the light year as a distance scale for star and galaxy size distances depends on the speed of light being a special maximum speed and the same for all the different wavelengths of light in the vacuum of space.  It is shown that modern scientific models should make testable predictions that then refine and advance our understanding of the physical world.</p>
<p><strong>SW-2:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>SW-3:</strong> Stress is placed on the growth of ideas, and how one theory builds on the next.  Also: until relatively recently (the beginning of the twentieth century), the prevalent view among scientists was that the sky is permanent and unchanging.  Today we can study and map the evolution of stars and planets, despite the enormous time frame involved.  A large percentage of the course is spent discussing these changes and the principles behind them.  It is amazing that just a hundred years ago it was widely believed that the Milky Way Galaxy was the entire universe.</p>
<p><strong>SW-4:</strong> More specifically, students are engaged to critically think and discuss as active citizens about two modern dialogues in science: (1) the unique role of Earth in the solar system as a habitat for life versus the problem of global climate change and global warming since the industrial revolution; (2) how the birth of nuclear science has led to our understanding of the Sun’s energy output, the development of nuclear weapons, and current debates in the news over the control and employment of nuclear weapons and energy sources, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives NS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives NS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students study “Biological Evolution” from both contemporary and historical perspectives - through readings in the modern text, “Biology, Evolution and Human Nature”(Wiley, 2001) and through Darwin’s original writings in “The Origin of Species” (1859). Student writing assignments and class discussion focus on analysis and interpretation of evolutionary ideas from Darwin’s perspective as well as current thought, 150 years later. Films, from a series “Prehistoric Man - Human Evolution”, are viewed, presenting interviews with several notable contemporary paleoanthropologists/evolutionary biologists, such as Ian Tattersall of the American Museum of Natural History.  The mini-film series provides students with additional viewpoints on evolutionary processes. In addition to writing interpretive essays on assigned readings, students also develop original library research reports on evolutionary topics of particular interest to individual students.  These reports are developed through the semester, and require students to utilize several academic sources, that address a given topic from varying points of view.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Throughout the semester students analyze passages from “The Origin of Species”, to gain insights into how Darwin formatted and presented his theory of evolution through natural selection to a skeptical 19th century society. 
A critical read of Darwin’s writings and his sequencing of observations, first on “Domestic Productions” and then organisms “in nature’ gives students the opportunity to fully evaluate the development of Darwin’s theory.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Time is allotted weekly for class discussions of Darwin’s ideas in “The Origin of Species”.  Students select passages, within a designated chapter, and explain how the ideas reflect and support aspects of Darwin’s evolutionary theory.  Similarly, students write essay responses to assigned readings, where they evaluate passages in Darwin’s writings, and provide examples to support their conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>SW-1:</strong> An important focus of the Biological Evolution course is identifying and exploring the five primary methods of study (”five pillars of support”) that evolutionary biologists employ in their research: 1)the fossil record (paleontology and geology), 2)comparative anatomy and embryology, 3)population genetics, 4)biogeography, and 5)molecular genetics (e.g. DNA and protein comparisons). These techniques of study are addressed in textbook readings, and class discussion, where students evaluate the application of the various methods in particular case studies.</p>
<p><strong>SW-2:</strong> The course addresses how contemporary evolutionary studies are increasingly dependent on molecular genetics for evaluating ancestry.  Techniques like PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) are discussed, particularly in terms of the insights they provide into human ancestry.  Recent research on the role of Neanderthals in the modern human gene pool, primarily based on molecular genetics, is thoroughly discussed.</p>
<p><strong>SW-3:</strong> Students evaluate the evidence that Darwin provides in “The Origin of Species”, to support his evolutionary principles, namely, the fossil record, noted homologies between contemporary forms, and studies in biogeography.  Now, over 150 years after the publication of “The Origin of Species”, students reconsider and discuss the additional empirical evidence supporting evolutionary theory that is available through development in the fields of population genetics and molecular genetics.</p>
<p><strong>SW-4:</strong> Ethical issues come into play in the evolutionary landscape. In particular, the danger of “Social Darwinism” is discussed from a historical perspective, with its impact on government policy, such as immigration quotas. A conversation about the misappropriation of evolutionary ideas is forwarded, in terms of ethnic discrimination and prejudices that have continuously plagued society.</p>
<p><strong>SW-5:</strong> Education policy with regard to the teaching of evolution in public schools is addressed as a serious public concern, and serves as a topic for discussion. Students are called upon to distinguish between scientific theory, based on the scientific method, and cultural/religious ideologies. An awareness of misuse of the term “theory” in colloquial speech is discussed as a primary reason why the “theory” of evolution is not taken seriously by some.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-1:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>NOTE-2:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>NOTE-3:</strong> Since Bio. 025 is formatted as a seminar-style course, with considerable class time devoted to discussion, and sharing written responses, a maximum class size of 25-30 students is desirable.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> 1. Gather, interpret and assess information from a variety of resources and points of view.
Students  prepare reports on Chemistry in the News on topics of their own choice. Students are advised to look for articles in Science, Science News, Chemical and Engineering News, the science times section of the New York Times, Discover, and also internet resources which they believe are reliable based on what they have learned in class and their textbook. A copy of the article must be included with their report.

Students write an essay on a single topic of great current interest during Part 2 of the Final Examination. They choose a topic from a list of possible topics furnished by their instructor during the 14th week of class. The topics on the list include some that are listed in the Syllabus as issues.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Students are instructed to use the principles of chemistry that they learn in class to evaluate the content of  articles they read and try to find articles that raise issues which they feel could have important consequences for society, or certain segments of society, in the future.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students are instructed to define the issue or issues that an article raises and explain in their reports why they believe the issue(s)  could have important consequences in the future for society and what could be done to address the issue(s).</p>
<p><strong>SW-1:</strong> The course covers 11 chapters of an excellent textbook: “Chemistry for Changing Times” by Hill et al which is now in its 13th edition. (Three hour exams during the semester, a final exam which has an essay part, and Chemistry in the News essays are graded to measure learning.) The textbook’s approach is to provide a non-mathematical treatment of chemical principles and processes which is suitable for non-science majors and relate these to their use in human society. Each chapter is accompanied by a discussion of important issues that are related to the content. For example the first chapter is about how knowledge is gained in chemistry by making observations,  formulating and testing hypotheses,  the characteristics of science, and application of the scientific method to discover scientific laws and theories.  This  chapter also covers the nature of science and technology, basic and applied research, risk benefit analysis for new technologies, and what science can and cannot do. The application of chemical principles is described  throughout the textbook; these include: damage from harmful chemicals (destruction of the ozone layer, Rachel Carson’s warning about environmental damage posed by pesticides in “Silent Spring”), the 12 principles of Green Chemistry (designing chemicals and chemical processes which are beneficial for human health and the environment), use of nanotechnology to make consumer and industrial products, nuclear proliferation, dirty bombs, nuclear winter, recombinant DNA technology, gene therapy, the greenhouse effect and climate change, carbon tax on emissions, and renewable energy sources. All these issues are covered in class and the textbook.</p>
<p><strong>SW-2:</strong> One of the issues discussed in class which provides an excellent example of how science may have solved a problem that threatened to produce world-wide damage to plants and animals involves the discovery that the ozone layer in the stratosphere was thinning above the Antarctic region and elsewhere. The evidence was provided by spectroscopic determinations of the concentration of ozone in the stratosphere across the world made by satellites. Ozone in the stratosphere absorbs ultraviolet radiation from the sun which would otherwise reach the earth’s surface. The US National Research Council predicted that a 2-5 % increase in skin cancer would accompany each 1% depletion of the ozone layer. In 1974, Mario Molina and Sherwood Rowland proposed a  mechanism.for the destruction of ozone based on the presence of chloroflurocarbon(CFC) molecules in the stratosphere. CFC molecules contain bonds between carbon and chlorine atoms which can break when UV radiation is absorbed. A single chlorine atom released by a broken bond can trigger a chain reaction which destroys thousands of ozone molecules. An article in Science News about the discovery of the ozone “hole” helped create a great deal of media coverage. Molina and Sherwood were critized by other scientists for using a simplistic treatment of the stratosphere and the possibility that other mechanisms and chemical species could explain the hole. They were critized by manufacturers of CFCs which were in world-wide use as foaming agents for plastics, the dispersing gases in aerosol cans and the working fluid of refrigerators, freezers and automobile air conditioners. After a great deal of further study by scientists, many articles published in both the scientific literature and popular periodicals,  and presentations at meetings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science,  Molina and Sherwood’s theory was accepted by most of their critics and the public; in 1995 they were rewarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 1987 the United Nations addressed ozone depletion by approving the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement that enforces the reduction and final elimination of the production and use of substances that deplete ozone in the upper atmosphere. Study of the condition of the ozone layer continues to this day to learn whether the measures taken were successful.</p>

<p><strong>SW-4:</strong> Please see the discussion of ozone deletion above and the issues identified in the syllabus.</p>
<p><strong>SW-5:</strong> Scientists do speak out about issues that could concern the public (see the discussion of the depletion of the ozone layer above). In the 1970s scientists who were experts on the chemistry of the atmosphere expressed their concerns when US corporations were trying get Congress to approve an appropriation for funds that would enable them to compete with a European consortium to develop a Supersonic Transport (SST). Americvan industry argued that it had always been the world’s aerospace leader and needed government help to remain so. American scientists argued that the exhaust from a fleet of SSTs could cause great harm to the atmosphere. The media focused on this issue and it was opposition from an informed public that caused Congress to reject funding for this project. The European consortium went on to build and operate a small fleet of SSTs (the Concord.) The fleet was grounded several years ago after an accident but for economic and not safety reasons. During the 1950s many scientists , led by Linus Pauling who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1954, spoke out against the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons because of radioactive fallout which posed a health hazard; yet it took pressure from an informed public to get major nations to sign a nuclear test ban treaty in
1963 (Pauling won the Noble Peace prize for his efforts in 1962.

The material given here as well as the textbook should make it clear that this course is all about giving students who are not majoring in chemistry the knowledge and voice to express their concerns about scientific issues involving chemistry in a meaningful way.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> The course draws on written, video, and coding exercises to explore the nature of information itself. Indeed, Information Theory is the basis for the “Information” part of the course title. The other half of the course title refers to Artificial Intelligence, which is the field within the computer science discipline that specifically deals with assessing (digital) information in order to decide what is the best action to take given an incomplete or conflicting set of information to work with. The readings from The Most Human Human specifically address the question of how to compare human information processing with non-human agents that claim to mimic human performance.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> A key element of the course is the inclusion of a set of coding exercises. Analytic thinking is introduced through these exercises both by analyzing the structure of binary numbers and algorithms for manipulating them, and also by requiring students to analyze anomalies (”bugs”) in the process of generating correct code. Evidential reasoning is precisely the cognitive skill developed in this part of the course.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students provide brief written response to reading and video assignments at the beginning of each class, and a written “takeaway” summary of the key point(s) covered in the class at the end. Students can receive full credit for these small exercises simply by submitting work that “looks ok.” But they also are given the incentive of receiving extra credit for these writings when they go beyond simple summaries and show some creative or integrative insight, however briefly.
 
The midterm paper assignment is mostly an exercise in expository writing about the technical material covered in the course, but the final paper is structured specifically so that students state and justify a particular point of view with respect to digital technology.</p>
<p><strong>SW-1:</strong> The essence of the course is its exploration of fundamental concepts in computer science: information theory, artificial intelligence, and principles of coding. Gathering information, representing it meaningfully, and taking actions based on it are the essential scientific concepts developed in the course.</p>
<p><strong>SW-2:</strong> The essence of artificial intelligence is to design agents that analyze information gathered from the environment in order to make decisions based on that information. A goal of the course is to provide students with enough understanding of information encoding and basic probability theory so they can understand Bayesian reasoning. Achieving this by class #6 as shown in the class schedule given in the sample syllabus means that the students will be introduced to the concept of probabilistic reasoning early on; actual facility with the necessary calculations is not expected within the scope of this course.</p>
<p><strong>SW-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>SW-4:</strong> As the sample syllabus shows, the second half of the course addresses issues of big data, cybersecurity, and privacy in the digital world of Big Data. The final paper assignment is structured to give students a way to do exactly what this learning outcome calls for: to articulate and evaluate the impact of digital technologies on their lives and the nature of social structures.</p>

<h3 id="SWENSCI112">ENSCI 112 Our Changing Planet [SW SCI]</h3><h4>Approved 2012-12-05</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Environmental science, like the other natural sciences, gains knowledge from objective observation, experimentation and rational analysis. Questions arise from observations of some aspect of the world and lead to hypotheses that can be tested.  Data are acquired from many different modes of observation and experimentation ranging in scale from NASA satellite  scans of the earth’s surface, to electron microprobe data of a crystal inclusion. Evidence (observations) are used deductively to reach conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Nature, a concept that includes the environment, has stimulated the most important thoughts of philosophers and scientists, such as Aristotle and Lucretius in the classical world, Descartes and Rousseau of the enlightenment and on to the modern leaders in the field, e.g., G. Likens, (experimental ecology), J. Hanson (global climate analysis) and W. Broecker (marine geochemistry). It includes the newly emerging concept of the urban environment as an ecosystem and the earth’s biosphere itself as a homeostatic entity. Thus, environmental science has been at the forefront of liberal thinking that created the concept of arts and sciences.  Many scientists now recognize the current geological time as the Anthropocene because Man has become a driving force of the earth’s geochemistry and surficial geology.  The evolving catastrophe of anthropogenic climate change is becoming a critical issue in current politics and is likely to become the single most important issue for society in the 21st century.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> After a review of the principal sub-disciplines of environmental science one of several issues of anthropogenic forcing of the Earth system is introduced.  The course presents students with readings from current literature, the Internet and popular media on each of these topics as listed in the syllabus and course schedule.  The lectures provide he scientific background in sufficient detail for students to grasp the central point of the public discussion and evaluate it from the perspective of science.  In addition, students are required to read one of a dozen or so books dealing with one or more aspects of anthropogenic change, from a list prepared by the instructor.  Students must write a book report, including their own assessment of what they learned from the book and submit this (detailed in the syllabus).  The instructor reviews, corrects, grades and returns the reports with corrective comments on substance, style and English usage.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> One of the purposes of this course is to inculcate critical reading and critical thinking, especially about environmental issue, in order to improve studentsʼ abilities to function as informed citizens in a democracy. For example, the historical development of the theory of plate tectonics is presented in which Wegener marshaled geophysical and paleontological evidence that the continents were previously contiguous, only to have his theory rejected by nearly all of his peers.  How geologists came to accept the theory is illustrative of the central process of science and a lesson in critical and analytical thinking.</p>

Students must write a book report, including their own assessment of what they learned from the book and submit this (detailed in the syllabus).  The instructor reviews, corrects, grades and returns the reports with corrective comments on substance, style and English usage.</p>
<p><strong>SW-1:</strong> Students will learn to apply fundamental concepts of science in general, such as
evidence-based deductive reasoning, to evaluating scientific theories such as anthropogenic climate change, the Gaia theory, plate tectonic theory, etc.   Environmental science is inherently multidisciplinary, drawing on biology, chemistry, physics, oceanography,limnology, meteorology, sociology, law and political science, and other fields so this course is a good means of exploring the scientific world.</p>
<p><strong>SW-2:</strong> The value of hypothesis driven science, leading to theories that explain the functions of the Earth system, is laid out quite clearly in this course.  These are laid out in a very lightly-drawn cntext of system modelling so that it can be shown that our theoretical understanding allows us to predict weather, distribution of debris from Fukushima to California on the marine currents, and many other phenomena.  The readings from current literature illustrate the immediacy of such issues and the course material provides the basis for understanding the world around us.</p>
<p><strong>SW-3:</strong> This course emphasizes the historical development of theories about the Earth system.  The role of empirical evidence played in the development of theories is a central element of the class. For example the evidence marshaled by Alfred Wegener in the early 20th century in his development of the theory of plate tectonics is presented, as is the reason for rejection of his theory by the scientific community, and the evidence-based developments of observational capabilities later in the 20th centry that led to the acceptance of plate tectonics as a standard model in geology.</p>
<p><strong>SW-4:</strong> From the perspective of both the individual and the larger community, this course will examine
contemporary issues of energy use, environmental ethics and personal responsibility as factors in an individual’s participation in democratic processes.</p>
<p><strong>SW-5:</strong> The course is about how the Earth system responds to forcing of Earth’s energy balance and energy fluxes through the hydrosphere, atmosphere, geosphere and biosphere.   The laws of motion and thermodynamics are presented as the basis for scientific understanding of the earth system iand its responses to anthropogenic energy use and the release of carbon from geological storage into the atmosphere. A key lesson is that this understanding underlies recommendations for policies intended to mitigate anthropogenic impacts on the Earth system.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Environmental science, like the other natural sciences, gains knowledge from objective observation, experimentation and rational analysis. Questions that lead to hypotheses are derived from observations of some aspect of the world, be it gas generation by bacteria, or patterns of drought observed over vast tracts of land.  Data are acquired from many different modes of observation ranging in scale from NASA satellite scans of the earth’s surface, to electron microprobe data of a crystal inclusions.  Questions leading to hypotheses are most commonly addressed by deductive reasoning based on the available data.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Nature, a concept that includes the environment, has stimulated the most important thoughts of philosophers and scientists, such as Aristotle and Lucretius in the classical world, Descartes and Rousseau of the enlightenment and on to the modern leaders in the field, e.g., G.

The evolving catastrophe of anthropogenic climate change is becoming a critical issue in current politics and is likely to become the single most important issue for society in the 21st century.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Sources of information will include data from the meteorological station located on the Science Building, national climate data sets, expert reports and popular media reports concerning food , water and air safety, as well as current articles from media such as the New York Times and Daily News.  Students will learn how to use the Internet for data gathering from sources such as NYCDEP, NYSDEC and so on.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> The purpose of the course is to inculcate critical thinking, especially about environmental issue in order to improve students’ abilities to function as informed citizens in a democracy. For example, the topic of climate change and its current and future effects in New York will be discussed.  Students will be presented with contrasting points of view and encouraged to evaluate the sources of the disagreements, the motivations of the “experts” and to evaluate the validity of contrasting arguments.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students are required to produce lab reports that include sections dealing with data sources, data tables, data analysis, and conclusions.  In addition, they are required to place the subject of the report into a sociological context, that is, express the arguments revolving around topics such as climate, water, air and food safety, or transportation system efficiency, in the context of the public discussion.  Section instructors will evaluate and correct these lab reports including the content previously described and the use of English language.  The reports are returned to the students with this feedback.</p>
<p><strong>SW-1:</strong> Students will learn to identify and apply fundamental concepts of environmental science, such as evidence-based reasoning, quantification, statistical analysis and evaluation of risk, to evaluating the need for cost/benefit trade-offs  and topics such as dealing with NIMBY behavior.  Environmental science is inherently multidisciplinary, drawing on biology, chemistry, physics, oceanography, limnology, meteorology, sociology, law and political science, and other fields so this course is a good means of exploring the scientific world.</p>
<p><strong>SW-2:</strong> By taking a core set of topics that intersect with the daily lives of everyone, and examining them through these multidisciplinary lenses (above), students will learn how the scientific world has real meaning for their own lives. By increasing knowledge of environmental issues and increasing skills in writing, students will be better prepared to participate in public and private discussions relating to societal needs and actions vis-s-vis environmental problem solving.</p>
<p><strong>SW-3:</strong> Students will make observations from data, develop hypotheses, analyze and evaluate the emperical evidence that supports, or not, the hypotheses they have developed. This entire process will be incorporated into their written lab reports.</p>
<p><strong>SW-4:</strong> From the perspective of both the individual and the larger community, this course will examine contemporary issues of energy use, environmental ethics and personal responsibility, the emerging role of the Internet in collating environmental data that relates to aspects of individual and group economic behavior, e.g., public investment in solving environmental problems. By examining environmental issues that intersect with the economic choices we make every day, students can evaluate their own ethical responsibility vis-a-vis the environment.</p>
<p><strong>SW-5:</strong> The course deals with energy use, food, water, air and climate, all of which are subject to regulation.  A key lesson, overall, is that regulation in these areas needs to be based on a scientific understanding of the complex environmental system, the interactions of humans in the environment, and feedback between human behavior and the goods and services that the environment provides to us.</p>

<p><strong>SW-1:</strong> The course covers 13 chapters from Nutrition: An Applied Approach by Thompson and Manore, 4th edition. The textbook provides an accurate, up-to-date, evidence-based and in-depth study of the science and principles of nutrition. Chapters cover the fundamental concepts and methods of nutrition science. The textbook starts with introduction of basic concepts such as ‘nutrients’, ‘kilo calorie’ and discussion of scientific method and types of research studies used in nutrition. The scientific process and basis for establishing dietary reference intakes, and dietary guidelines for Americans is discussed as well as how these influence national food and nutrition policies and programs available to society. Nutrition tools such as food labels and interactive web-based MyPlate.gov that incorporate dietary guidelines and empower individuals in making healthy food and lifestyle choices are then discussed. Subsequent chapters cover individual nutrients, their requirements (Dietary Reference Intakes), food sources, national consumption patterns, digestion, absorption, utilization, metabolism, transport, storage and excretion. 
See Research and Dietary Analysis Assignments in revised FNES 163 Syllabus and Assignments 2015.
Students are also evaluated on their understanding by questions provided within exams and in-class assignments.</p>
<p><strong>SW-2:</strong> Using the technology-based online interactive MyPlate tracker*, students are instructed to assess dietary data against Dietary Guidelines for Americans and nutrient requirements based on the National Academy of Science’s Dietary Reference Intakes, identify nutrition problems such as nutrient deficiencies and excesses, and develop strategies to address the problems. See attached Dietary Analysis Assignment in revised FNES 163 Syllabus and Assignments 2015. 
* United States Department of Agriculture – Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion’s online interactive tools operationalize the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and empower consumers (students) to make healthier choices with resources and tools for dietary assessment, nutrition education, and other nutrition information. As Americans are experiencing epidemic rates of overweight and obesity, the online resources and tools can empower people to make healthier food choices for themselves, their families, and their children (source: www.choosemyplate.gov).
Students are introduced to new disciplines in nutrition such as nutrigenomics, which studies the interaction between genes, the environment and nutrition and can provide broader understanding of problems such as the obesity epidemic and other disease states.

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students not only read about disasters in their textbook, but every class reviews news media and internet accounts of disasters and students learn to evaluate information from different sources. Out-of-class assignments allow students practice gathering creditable resources and evaluating information independently as well.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Classes 1 through 5 introduce students to modern concepts about Earth’s internal and surficial processes which are used to evaluate those concepts in subsequent classes through their application to natural disasters. Examples include the relationships of volcanic and earthquake disasters to the plate tectonic model (Classes 8 and 9) and flooding (11), sinkhole collapse (12, 15), and landslides (13) to modern views of landscape evolution. Written assignments require students to practice their skills of critical evaluation of evidence by applying topics learned in class to current events.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Thought the semester students will be shown how to evaluate geohazards in the media by learning how to compare them to known concepts in geology. Students will also be taught how to document their arguments with literature citations. The examples in class will provide the students with a frame work on how to construct their geohazard journals. These assignments give the student an opportunity to produce a well reasoned argument about the causes and effects of a current geohazard but encorporating information from the textbook and media sources.</p>
<p><strong>SW-1:</strong> The first three and a half weeks of the course introduce students to fundamental geologic concepts and explain how geoscientists arrived at those concepts through observation, hypothesis, and experimentation. For example the recognition that Earth processes are caused by both internal (Class 2) and external (5) energy sources and that Earth recycles a finite amount of material (4). The remainder of the course applies these basics to understanding the causes of natural disasters; Volcanic and Earthquake hazards (Class 8-9) applies the concepts of plate tectonics and earths internal energy (2,4) and classes 7-15 relate to the effects of Earth’s external energy source (5). The last third of the curriculum focuses on the anthropogenic aspect of geologic hazards—waste disposal (Class 17), wetland destruction and costal issues (18,23-24), atmospheric and weather hazards (16, 25-28)—which enforces the concept of limited resources (4) and their relationship to public policy and decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>SW-2:</strong> Lectures are replete with examples of how technology is used to predict, analyze and mitigate geologic hazards. Examples include retaining walls for preventing landslides (Class13), seawalls to prevent flooding (24) and flexible structural members to limit collapse in earthquakes (8). We also consider the limits of technological solutions in permanently eliminating hazards which is present throughout the curriculum but a exemplary example would be the inability of scientist to predict the exact timing of an earthquake (Class 8) or the continual coastal flooding that will occur as sea level rises (24,27).</p>
<p><strong>SW-3:</strong> Three decades ago we believed that extraterrestrial impacts on Earth were rare. Lunar exploration showed the surface to be full of craters. How could our sister body have been impacted and not us? 
Introducing theories about the origin of the atmosphere and hydrosphere allows us to understand that the earth was originally cratered but that the evidence has been lost by erosion and burial. Development of geophysical methods has enabled us to find those “lost” craters and support the theory.</p>
<p><strong>SW-4:</strong> Technology has been used to eliminate hazards. In this course we discuss how a solution to a problem in one area creates a new one in another (a displaced problem). For example, Midwestern steel plants built higher smoke stacks to eliminate local pollution problems.  A decade later, trees started dying on mountain ranges in the Northeast. The steel cities had cleaner air, but the Northeast 
Such displaced problems create ethical concerns. Do the needs of a local area justify transferring problems to another area? The air in the steel producing cities is now clear , but the Northeast now had acid rain. This is one of many examples of a displaced problem that are discussed in this class.</p>
<p><strong>SW-5:</strong> There is widespread concern about the possibility of “global warming”. Are the observations accurate? What are the different sides of the discussion? Has climate changed
 changed in the past and why? To understand the problem of climate change we review the role of gasses in warming and the natural and industrial origin of these gasses. How should our findings affect future policy initiatives?</p>

<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Previously approved for the Perspectives NS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students will not only read scientific accounts of volcanism and seismicity, but will also read or observe films of historic earthquakes and volcanic eruptions (including Vesuvius/Pompeii; Krakatoa; Mt. St. Helens; 1906 San Francisco and 21st century Indian Ocean and Japan.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Several theories have been advanced in the past 400 years to explain earthquakes, volcanoes, and what they tell about subterranean Earth processes. Students will examine evidence for these theories and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each. This starts with Lecture 1 and continues throughout the entire course.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Student assignments require them to use observations and data to support conclusions about Earth processes (see Exercises 1, 2, 3, 4)</p>
<p><strong>SW-1:</strong> In this course, students are exposed to the questioning nature of science – the research methods, special forms of reasoning, and elementary concepts embedded in the geologic sciences. Two of the most dramatic Earth processes (earthquakes, volcanoes) are used to illustrate the basic scientific process.</p>
<p><strong>SW-2:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>SW-3:</strong> The entire course is an examination of how basic observations coupled with technological advances in instrumentation provide evidence for a major scientific theory – the plate tectonic model for the Earth and other terrestrial planets. The theory is presented in the first lecture and the roles of volcanic and seismic evidence in its development are traced historically.</p>
<p><strong>SW-4:</strong> Students will learn how scientific discoveries about the causes and nature of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions have impacted civil defense preparations, disaster planning, and zoning for different types of land use.
Examples: submarine resources associated with volcanic eruptions (Lec. 9); role of volcanic materials in agriculture (8, 9); predicting volcanic eruption and saving lives (6-9); and similar topics for earthquakes (24-28)</p>
<p><strong>SW-5:</strong> Throughout the entire course, students explore the natural hazards created by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions and how these, in turn, dictate appropriate building codes, budget decisions, and environmental legislation. This information is included in lectures 6-11;17; 24-28.</p>

<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Our society’s need and usage of natural resources and the resultant impact on the environment are constantly changing with new technologies and ways of living, so, in addition to the standard textbook, a frequently updated variety of informational materials will be made available through Blackboard for students to learn about the sources of minerals and energy that are critical to modern societies.  This required course material include reports from government and other agencies, selected readings from other texts and current events articles from the New York Times and other media sources.  They also include short documentary films from different points of view on historical development and current choices in energy, mineral and other natural resource use.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> In course meetings and online (Blackboard) discussions, students are expected to reflect on and discuss historical events and political/policy decisions that have led to the current global demand for and usage of natural resources.  They are asked to evaluate alternative collective societal and governmental choices in light of the impact of current resource and energy use on the environment, and assess the evidence supporting or refuting current policy choices or proposals to change those policies. From these analyses, students learn how geoscientists develop unbiased understanding about resource availability and impacts on the environment.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> In addition to weekly class and online discussion forums, students have two short (3-5 page) writing assignments in which they are expected to respond to and/or critique the two documentary films on natural resource or energy use.  In addition to presenting well-organized opinions on the films in clear and correct language, these papers will be graded on how well students support their assertions using factual information and the extent to which they distinguish the biases of the film-makers, and situate them in the broader context of material learned in the course.</p>
<p><strong>SW-1:</strong> In class meetings as well as readings, students learn how geoscientists observe the natural world, the abundance and limits of mineral, energy and other natural resources, by means of graphical and narrative presentation of scientific data.  As societies and civilizations change their use of resources, the resultant geological and environmental processes (depletion of raw materials, accumulation of wastes) that cause changes in the environment due to resource exploitation will be explained and discussed.</p>
<p><strong>SW-2:</strong> Students see how geoscientists collect and interpret data, on scales from local to global, relevant to the availability and scarcity of finite mineral, energy and other natural resources in the past and future.  Case studies are provided of specific resource depletion and how societies adapted to that depletion by substitution or other means.</p>
<p><strong>SW-3:</strong> In lecture and discussion, students learn about the accumulating evidence for global climate change and fossil fuel and mineral resource depletion, and how that is driving natural resource and energy policy changes.</p>
<p><strong>SW-4:</strong> Students will experience a historical perspective on the discovery and development of energy and mineral resources and how technology has created demand for and altered use of natural resources.  Natural resource consumption is dependent on population, so per-capita resource exploitation and population growth, technological advance as well as scientific discovery of the consequences of such exploitation are central to an understanding of future trends.</p>
<p><strong>SW-5:</strong> Through multiple choice tests and other assessments, students will demonstrate their understanding of how public policy and regulatory authority may be informed by scientific principles, as well as economic, social and political considerations.</p>

<p><strong>REV-U:</strong> QC (No. 1 of 2 needed):
Address how, in the discipline (or disciplines) of the course, data and evidence are construed and knowledge is acquired; that is, how questions are asked and answered.

        	
In the field of meteorology and climatology, questions arise as consequences of an observation of the natural world. The observation leads to the formation of a hypothesis that can be experimentally tested. Thus, the scientific method has been fundamental for our understanding of earth climate system. Because students are very interested in weather and climate, climatology and meteorology are excellent models for students to learn about the scientific method. In this course, students will learn how meteorologists study the atmosphere by collecting data, making a hypothesis, and using observations to validate their predictions. This scientific skill will be discussed by different examples in lectures, and practiced in home work assignments. Data are acquired from many different sources, national weather stations, NASA satellite images, and DOE eddy-flux networks.

QC (No. 2 of 2 needed):
Position the discipline(s) in the liberal arts curriculum and the larger society.
        	
Science is an essential part of a liberal-arts education. Climatology as applied science contributes to the liberal-arts curriculum in four aspects: (1) the subject of climatology is a significant aspect of human life; (2) many front-page issues are related to weather and climate (global warming, ozone depletion, air pollution, hurricanes and tornadoes); (3) forecasting is an essential part of critical thinking; and (4) sciences of the atmosphere are multidisciplinary, drawing not only on physics and mathematics, but also on chemistry, biology, computer science, and other disciplines.

FCC (No. 1 of 3 needed):
Gather, interpret, and assess information from a variety of sources and points of view.	

Hurricanes, Tornados, and other extreme weathers are often reported in the media, particularly the impact of extreme weather events on the Megacity (New York). Current informational materials will be gathered and made available to students through Blackboard: (1) what predictions are made before extreme events; (2) how did people and governments respond to the events; and (3) how these extreme weather and climate events are related to anthropogenic forcing.  In homework assignments, students will be asked to think about and provide their own assessments guided by series of questions relating to the specific weather event. For example, with hurricane Sandy questions may include: (1) were meteorologists’ predictions accurate? (2) where did meteorologists get the information they needed to make this predictions? (3) was there relationship between Sandy and long-term climate patterns? And (4) was the megacity adequately prepared for Sandy? Students will be encouraged to discuss these questions in the lecture sections. 

FCC (No. 2 of 3 needed):
Evaluate evidence and arguments critically or analytically.
        	
With respect to discussion of extreme weather events, the instructor will then provide his summary overview on these questions and encourage further discussions. This will highlight the critical thinking and analysis that is central to the scientific process.

Meteorological forecasting is an excellent example of critical thinking.  In lectures, the instructor will discuss specific examples of how meteorologists and climatologists make their predictions and assess their accuracy. For example, Paul Crutzen, Mario Molina and Sherwood Rowland have all made pioneering contributions to explaining how ozone is formed and decomposes through chemical processes in the atmosphere. Most importantly, they have in this way showed how sensitive the ozone layer is to the influence of anthropogenic emissions of certain compounds. The instructor will show students how observation of natural world stimulated scientific curiosity and led to a series of hypotheses that won them the Nobel Prize. 

FCC (No. 3 of 3 needed):
Produce well-reasoned written or oral arguments using evidence to support conclusions.
        	
In homework, students are asked to use the information and theories they have learned to predict the results of different situations that follow the same principles as learned in lectures. For example, all atmospheric circulations are driven mainly by pressure differences that are caused by temperature differences. This principle can be used to explain global general circulation pattern, sea breeze, land breeze, valley breeze, winter/summer monsoon, and so on. For instance, students might be asked to explain how the pressure patterns of the sea breeze are analogous to the structure of a hurricane in a test.

SW (No. 1 of 3 needed):
Identify and apply the fundamental concepts and methods of a discipline or interdisciplinary field exploring the scientific world.	

In class meetings, for example, students learn that the capacity of water-holding of the atmosphere is determined by temperature (Clausius-Clapeyron principle). Students are request to use this principle to explore (understand) why extreme weather events have become more frequent and intense in the warming world.

SW (No. 2 of 3 needed):
Demonstrate how tools of science, mathematics, technology, or formal analysis can be used to analyze problems and develop solutions.	

In class meetings, students learn how atmospheric scientists use a simplified model to demonstrate how temperature differences produce pressure differences and hence leads to atmospheric circulations from small scale (sea breeze) to global scale (general circulation). Students will be able to see how scientists simplify the complicated nature before they understand how nature works. The simplification skill is critical for students to find a solution for a complicated issue or a problem.

SW (No. 3 of 3 needed):
Articulate and evaluate the empirical evidence supporting a scientific or formal theory.
        	
Greenhouse effect is based on radiation theories. Global warming is considered as consequences of greenhouse gases (CO2) increasing in the atmosphere due to anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions. In lectures and discussions, students learn accumulating evidence of fossil fuel emissions, atmospheric CO2 increasing, and temperature increasing since industrialization began and how these evidence supports scientific theory.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> In environmental science and the natural sciences, knowledge is acquired using the scientific method, in which empirical evidence, carefully collected via observation or experimentation, is used to address a testable hypothesis.  The testable hypothesis is either supported or rejected.  The process is iterative and leads to continued modification or refinement of the original hypothesis.  The process is intended to be repeatable and objective.    In this course the students will be introduced to the scientific method (lecture 2), and how data is gathered and used in hypothesis testing related to local case studies (e.g. Hudson River water quality data in lecture 10 and the water quality homework assignment).  Student presentations will require students to interpret previously gathered public data related to environmental issues and decision making (classes 7, 13, 16, 21 and 23-26).  Concepts related to how the natural system functions and responses to anthropogenic change will be explored in most lectures including atmospheric chemistry and circulation, the hydrologic cycle, energy resource production and consumption (underlying operation of the Natural World, classes 3, 5, 6, 9, 14 and 19).</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> When applied to environmental issues, scientific knowledge is used to inform decision-making and environmental policy by considering the cost and benefits of different actions, including both objective and subjective valuation. Student debates and presentation of case studies will be used to identify environmental issues facing society, identify the interested parties in society, and the opposing view points at a global (e.g. production of greenhouse gasses and incentives to reduce emissions), national (e.g. enforcement of the Clean Water Act vs large investment in new infrastructure that would be required), and local level (how should New York City balance population growth with the conservation or expansion of public “green” space and parks).   During the course students will investigate how New York City plans to address major environmental concerns associated with population expansion by the year 2030 (PLANYC lectures and presentations, classes 22-26). The changes in the functioning of the natural system in response to human activities will be explored in most lectures (classes 3, 5, 6, 9, 14 and 19).</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students will be engaged in active inquiry during water quality data analysis (homework due class 13), and in researching their debate and PLANYC presentation topics, including gathering and interpretation of data to support these presentations. Student debates and presentation of case studies will be used to identify environmental issues facing society, identify the interested parties in society, and the opposing view points at a global (e.g. production of greenhouse gasses and incentives to reduce emissions), national (e.g. enforcement of the Clean Water Act vs large investment in new infrastructure that would be required), and local level (how should New York City balance population growth with the conservation or expansion of public “green” space and parks).  Students will also read articles from a New York Times series on water pollution that discusses opposing points of view related to water resource usage. Primary scientific data sets and journal articles will be used by students in classes 10, 14, 18 and during PLANYC 2030 presentation preparation (classes 22-26).</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Students will both debate (classes 7, 13, 16, 21) and present (classes 22-26) cases studies that require critical evaluation of opposing viewpoints on environmental issues.  They will be required to use scientific data to evaluate the issue and they will be graded in part based on the clarity of their argument.  During the water quality homework assignment, students will analyze water quality data and use that data to support an argument for alterations in wastewater infrastructure investment and management of recreational usage.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students debates (classes 7, 13, 16, 21) and presentations (classes 22-26) require both written and oral arguments to support evaluation of environmental issues and the use of scientific data in supporting their conclusions.  Debates include contrasting opinions on solutions to environmental challenges in areas including: Population, Food Supply, Air Quality, Climate Change, and Energy.</p>
<p><strong>SW-1:</strong> Students will be taught about the scientific method (class 2) and will use data sets to test hypotheses (e.g.  water quality homework assignment, testing hypotheses relating rainfall and water quality in the Hudson River).   They will also evaluate scientific data that has been collected in relation to the human alteration of the natural system including climate change (lecture 14) and air pollution (lecture 15).</p>
<p><strong>SW-2:</strong> Students will use basic mathematical and statistical description (e.g. mean, median, and linear correlation) to analyze a water quality data set and the problem of sewage pollution (class 13).  They will propose environmental solutions related to infrastructure improvements and improved management of recreational use.  Students will also describe the use of these tools of science in addressing environmental problems faced by New York City (PLANYC presentations in classes 22-26).</p>
<p><strong>SW-3:</strong> Students will critically evaluate and discuss the evidence for the connection between greenhouse gases and climate change and the role of human actions in altering climate.  The scientific method and the difference between a hypothesis and a theory will be introduced in lecture 2.  The evaluation of evidence supporting the theory of greenhouse gas driven climate change will be discussed in classes 14, 15, and 16.</p>
<p><strong>SW-4:</strong> The use of technologies including the combustion engines and powerplants (class 19-21), wastewater treatment plants (classes 9-13), and genetic modification agricultural products (classes 6 and 7) and their impact on human quality of life and public health will be evaluated in the class.  In addition students will discuss the use of technologies related to New York City environmental issues and quality of life during presenations in classes 22-26).</p>
<p><strong>SW-5:</strong> Throughout the course students will explore the connections between the functioning of the natural world and societies utilization of natural resources. Students will explore the scientific principles that allow society to determine if water and air are polluted and how we choose to enforce the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-1:</strong> The course is not required for any major.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-2:</strong> none.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-3:</strong> Enrollment is expected to be a maximum of 40 students per section to allow for discussion and active group participation during the class (e.g. group debates and presentations).</p>
<h3 id="SWHNRS225">HNRS 225 Science and Technology in New York City [SW SCI]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-02-13</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives NS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives NS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> HNRS 225 is taught by faculty from Computer Science, Earth and Environmental Science, Physics, and Biology.  Students in this course learn the methodology of science, read scientific literature from multiple disciplines, complete a collaborative research project, and present that project publicly as a poster or PowerPoint presentation in a session held at the Graduate Center.  Since New York City is the focus of their investigation, students not only learn about, but also experience, the impact of science on modern society.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Students analyze scientific and technological topics that have had an impact on contemporary New York.  These may include technology and computers, urban health issues, the environment, and energy.  The class will address the intellectual and historical roots of the semester’s topic(s), as well as the ethical, legal, social, and economic ramifications.  Students will read scientific literature and learn the technical concepts necessary to understand and evaluate their readings.  The class will also engage students in scientific inquiry.  In-class work and homework assignments will be enriched by visits to institutions such as the Hayden Planetarium, the Mount Sinai Medical Center, and other important research centers.  These enrichments enable students to evaluate the ways that scientific theory is put into practice.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> As these descriptions and the learning objectives (below) show, by examining scientific issues and topics within the context of New York City this class positions itself at the intersection of science and the larger society.  Students are engaged not only in learning how to ask and answer questions within the subject discipline but in learning how to prepare and present answers in scientific disciplines through a poster or PowerPoint presentation.</p>
<p><strong>SW-1:</strong> The course focuses on major scientific concepts and their relationship to technological developments affecting New York City.  Topics vary according to the scientific expertise of the instructor and may include the following: genetic engineering, ecological determinants, energy issues, AIDS or other diseases.  Students will read scientific literature and learn the fundamentals of science necessary to understand the reading.  This is addressed in the first of four learning objectives for the course: 
Students will 1. “Develop and demonstrate an awareness of the messiness and complexity of the progress of scientific knowledge by reading and writing about the intellectual roots of the seminar topic.”</p>
<p><strong>SW-2:</strong> Students will engage in scientific inquiry by working in teams to ask and answer questions relevant to the topic and their lives.  One example of how this was accomplished in the seminar follows: “students in this seminar will explore how NYC addresses the needs of people with disabilities in the areas of public transportation, city services, government websites, museums, parks, cultural performances, and urban infrastructure (city streets, crossing signs, wheelchair ramps). Students will learn how assistive-technology researchers evaluate the needs of their taret users, design technology for some use, design an experiment to test the effectiveness of the technology, analyze the results, and then design the system.”  Other faculty may take different approaches, but the analysis of scientific problems and the development of solutions to these problems is consistent across the seminar.  This is addressed in the second and third of the four learning objectives for the course:  Students will 2. “Practice critical thinking through the evaluation of scientific and technological issues and through the public presentation of their research.” Students will 3. “Learn to research literature on specific science and technology topics and to use the Internet to identify relevant data sources.”</p>
<p><strong>SW-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>SW-4:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>SW-5:</strong> The relationship between scientific inquiry and public policy, or issues of public concern, is an important emphasis of the course. Two examples will illustrate how this emphasis has been addressed by faculty. 1) “Environmental Science is a rich and complex subject because it spans physical, chemical, biological, geological, atmospheric, terrestrial, engineering, economic, political, social and cultural dimensions, all interwoven into global-scale problems of immediate implications for the health of the planet and for the stability of human societies.  Although this seminar will emphasize the global nature of these problems, we will repeatedly encounter and examine important implications for NYC.”  2) “The seminar will look at how disease results from a number of social, economic, scientific, and environmental factors and how it differently impacts the social groups living and working in NYC.  It will also take a broad historical and contemporary view on public health to show the importance of the state, the law, social movements, medical practices, and alternative health practices in shaping overall city health.”  Other faculty may take different approaches, but the impact of scientific principles on public policy or issues of public concern is consistent across the seminar.  This is addressed by the fourth of the four learning objectives for the course: Students will 4. “Understand scientific principles by analyzing one or more problems in detail.”</p>
<h3 id="SWLCD102">LCD 102 Analyzing Language [SW LANG SCI]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-04-13</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> The subject of the course is linguistic structure or formal linguistics, which comprises analysis at various levels:  phonology (sound structure), morphology (word structure), syntax (phrase and sentence structure), semantics (structural aspects of meaning), and pragmatics (contextual aspects of meaning). Formal linguistic hypotheses in all these areas propose specific abstract analyses of structures attested in individual languages and dialects. They are confirmed or refuted empirically, based on their provision of consistent explanatory accounts for why the structures or patterns of structures are found, whereas other structures or co-occurrence of structures are not found. Data to confirm or refute hypotheses are derived in two ways: 1) through attestation of structures in corpora of actual speech and writing and 2) through native speakers’ intuitive judgments of which structures are grammatical or possible versus ungrammatical or impossible in their language.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Formal linguistics, under the rubric of grammar, is one of the oldest areas of scholarship although at earlier times efforts were limited to classification, typology and taxonomy of language patterns. This subject matter also formed a core area of education in the Western tradition for many centuries. In the 19th Century, grammar joined rhetoric and literary criticism to form philology and later, in the US on the school level, language arts. More recently, however, the position of grammar in language arts declined significantly. At the same time, the scientific study of language, linguistics, has largely replaced the philological tradition in language research.

LCD 102 is an effort to reengage with the skill set and the awareness of the nature of the primary means of human communication that has been lost with the decline of grammar instruction. In its contemporary scientific incarnation, grammar study engages the natural human curiosity about how human language, by far the most complex of known natural communication systems, works. The type of analysis uses inductive reasoning based on empirical facts to arrive at abstract generalizations that account for superficially heterogeneous phenomena. These generalizations reveal how different languages are characterized by systematic similarities and differences.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> The bulk of the course consists of analysis of data sets that exemplify the target phenomena derived from grammars and corpora from a variety of languages. When languages are familiar to our linguistically diverse students, however, they are encouraged to use their own intuitions as speakers. The learning is scaffolded as follows to facilitate interpretation of these data.  At first, students are exposed to and asked to evaluate and choose between competing analyses using the data from these sources to support their arguments. Later, students propose their own hypotheses when given patterns of data. When students propose contrasting hypotheses, these are evaluated in such as way as further illuminate underlying principles.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> The datasets used in the course are presented as problems requiring solution through inductive reasoning and employment of linguistic principles and concepts. The target answers will consist not only of conclusions but expression of the reasoning process through which the conclusion was arrived at. In this way, appropriate interpretation of data is a major course objective. The differences between valid and invalid linguistic analyses are discussed and practiced at length. Students are encouraged to constructively critique analyses proposed in course materials and by their classmates. This is done by pointing to potential counterexamples to and inconsistencies in proposed analyses and figuring out if modifications that preserve the essential insights of the proposed analysis will help overcome these obstacles or whether the basic analysis needs to be revisited.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Argumentation in favor of or opposed to particular hypotheses are made both orally in class and in written form in exercises and on tests and when feasible due to section size in investigative projects. Evidence confirming or refuting hypotheses is found in the data provided or, in the case of native speakers of a language, intuitive judgments of grammaticality, phonological well formedness, semantic correctness, or pragmatic felicity as the case may be. Students will be expected to not only provide descriptive accounts of their data but also supporting reasons for their accounts.</p>
<p><strong>SW-1:</strong> In contemporary linguistics, language is conceived of as a unique human capacity with biological roots in human evolution. In fact, it is, by far, the most complex communication system found in the natural world. Students are led to see individual grammars as real-world realizations of this innate linguistic capacity that develop in response to linguistic input in the environment. 

In LCD 102, students are taught to make generalizations about different human languages through examinations of their grammars using the tools of linguistic theories. Competing theories, for example those that posit highly specific innate knowledge versus those that see language as the outcome of general cognitive processes, are discussed in terms of how well they explain the data.

Inductive reasoning derived from raw linguistic data show commonalities on abstract levels to what are superficially diverse phenomena. For example, grammatical gender in familiar languages such as Spanish and French can come to be seen as a realization of the same fundamental principle that yields 10 or more noun classes in languages such as Swahili or Zulu.</p>
<p><strong>SW-2:</strong> In LCD 102 students use linguistic theories, concepts, and methods to arrive at valid analyses of linguistic data within and across various languages. Besides inductive reasoning, each subfield of linguistics is characterized by a number of theories and other formal principles. Students are shown how, for example, in phonology, syllable structures are highly constrained, and follow similar patterns cross-linguistically. In many cases, these constraints are shown to be motivated by logical, cognitive, or (in the case of phonology) physiological factors.</p>
<p><strong>SW-3:</strong> As stated above, the material for the course largely consists of working through linguistic data from which theoretical principles and universal patterns can be derived. Using these problem sets, students are first given and later led to propose hypotheses that follow from or support these principles. They are then asked to evaluate the hypotheses and defend their choices.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> This course was previously approved for the Natural Sciences (NS) Perspectives Area of Knowledge; so, no additional information is provided in response to this question.  
See list of approved PLAS courses here: http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/ctl/gened/geac/approved/index.html</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> This course was previously approved for the Natural Sciences (NS) Perspectives Area of Knowledge; so, no additional information is provided in response to this question. 
See list of approved PLAS courses here: http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/ctl/gened/geac/approved/index.html</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Students in this course are assigned readings by a variety of authors on scientific topics which are current sources of debate, e.g., cloning, genetic manipulation, etc.  The various readings (including Scientific American articles, novels, and other sources identified by the students) come from differing points of view, and students are asked to gather and interpret additional sources when preparing their oral presentations and essays for the course.  As part of their essay writing, oral presentations, and in-class discussions about these readings, students are asked to assess the value and merits of these arguments.  In addition, students are assigned various media (including film) that discuss these modern scientific topics, and students are asked to prepare written statements of philosophical questions raised by these films, in preparation for active in-class discussions.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> In-class discussions (many of which become debates on these current scientific issues) are an important aspect of this course, in which students actively formulate arguments, assess the evidence, and critically analyze the arguments presented by other students.   In addition, when preparing for oral presentations in class on controversial scientific issues, the students need to assess the variety of evidence and arguments presented in the articles and other readings gathered for their reference lists.  The students must formulate a coherent perspective on these issues, and this requires them to accept, reject, or incorporate various arguments and evidence in the readings they use.  In addition, students are asked to write and revise four essays during the course, in which they must present a thesis and organize and present evidence in support of their arguments.  This requires careful evaluation of the evidence and arguments present in their sources.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Writing (with revision) and oral presentations (including peer evaluations) are an essential aspect of this course, and are the major component of the students’ grades.  Students are asked to write approximately 10-12 pages of material for the four major essays in the course, and, in addition, students are also asked to formulate substantive reaction papers in response to readings and media that are assigned for the course.  As a major project in the course, students also assemble a list of references on a modern scientific concept, and they prepare an oral presentation on this topic, making use of these references, which they present in-class (with peer-evaluations).  The production of well-reasoned arguments (in support of specific conclusions) are an essential component of these assignments, and the use of preliminary essay outlines, essay revisions, and peer-evaluation of oral presentations provides additional opportunities for students to develop these skills.  Further, the primary focus of in-class time is discussion of the key scientific issues that are the focus of the readings and media, and this provides another important opportunity for students to develop and assess oral arguments.</p>
<p><strong>SW-1:</strong> The readings, in-class lectures, and in-class discussions in this course introduce students to several major contemporary issues in science.  Each of these issues centers on the main advances in a particular scientific field (e.g., advances in Artificial Intelligence, advances in Genetics, etc.).  In order for students to understand and discuss each concept, the instructor provides sufficient scientific background in the form of supplemental readings, introductory articles, and lecture materials.  Further, as part of students selection of topics for their essays and oral presentations, they investigate the fundamental concepts that underlie particular topics in the field - in greater depth.  An essential component of this background information includes information about the methods that are employed in these fields, and in-class activities reinforce this methodological information.  For instance, during an in-class activity, students perform an exercise on gene decoding to understand the underlying mechanism of how genes are sequenced.  As another example, students use an software program that allows them to simulate evolutionary processes.  In other activities, students conduct experiments that demonstrate aspects of human perception and memory, which introduce students to methodologies used in psychological studies.  This hands-on aspect of the course grounds the in-class discussions for students, and it facilitates their formulation of an educated viewpoint on these contemporary scientific issues.</p>
<p><strong>SW-2:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>SW-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>SW-4:</strong> Exploring the intersection of scientific and technological developments and the contemporary world is the primary focus of this course.  By examining several contemporary issues in science which have a significant societal and ethical component, students are challenged to unravel the implications of these issues on society and to consider how the future direction of several fields of science will open new ethical dilemmas.  Thoughtful in-class discussion is fostered through the viewing and consideration of several science-fiction films which present how advances in genetics, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, etc. could lead to unexpected impacts on society.  These films are coupled with novels and introductory articles drawn from Scientific American magazine (which are meant for a general, educated audience) that further explore these societal implications.  Students are encouraged to explore some of these themes in greater depth in their essays and in-class oral presentations, which require them to articulate and support informed opinions about these scientific developments and how they are shaping society.</p>
<p><strong>SW-5:</strong> By presenting science fiction films and novels which illustrate societal implications of scientific developments, students are motivated to understand the key scientific principles that underlie these issues.  Through in-class discussion and assigned reading, a recurring theme of the course is how government regulation, social norms, and other ethical frameworks intersect with new scientific developments.  These scientific advances raise questions of legality, normalcy, and ethics that may have never been previously considered, and students realize that they need to understand the science well enough to make informed decisions of how these legal, societal, and ethical principles apply.  Through readings in Scientific American, through in-class lectures, and through additional sources that students select and analyze (for their essays and for their oral presentations), students gain an understanding of the relevant scientific principles and developments.  Students demonstrate this mastery through their essays, in-class discussion contributions, oral presentation, and shorter writing assignments.</p>

<h3 id="SWPHIL225">PHIL 225 Philosophy of the Natural Sciences [SW SCI]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-02-13</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> The discipline of the course is philosophy, but the matter of the course is science, and in particular, the role of empirical evidence in scientific confirmation. The philosophical questions asked in the course address how, in the natural sciences, data and evidence are accrued and construed. These questions are answered not by the methods of science but those of philosophy: conceptual analysis, clarification of inferences, argument and counter-argument, etc. Necessarily, the relative status of these scientific and philosophical methodologies is explored. The understanding that students acquire of the concepts and methods of philosophy and those of the natural sciences are assessed in written and oral assignments.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> The discipline of philosophy and the disciplines of the natural sciences together provide the course with its content. The importance of science in modern society can hardly be overstated; understanding the fundamental methods of science is therefore a primary goal of the course. Understanding the relation of philosophy to the natural sciences is another: if philosophical claims about science are not themselves scientific, what sorts of claims are they?</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Different accounts of the nature of science form the main content of the course. These different accounts embody different presuppositions concerning confirmation, the role of observation, the importance of theoretical considerations such as coherence and simplicity. These differing accounts are examined and compared. In their study of scientific confirmation, students are exposed to the dangers in evidence selection and contamination, conscious or unconscious bias, etc. These skills are assessed in class discussions, an oral presentation, and in written essays in examinations.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> A principal topic of the course is the role that empirical evidence plays in science, as contrasted with theory-formation, model-building, idealization, etc. Different accounts of scientific reasoning disagree over the role of evidence. Choosing between accounts of scientific reasoning is not a scientific matter; philosophical considerations are also in play, and the arguments for and against various accounts of scientific confirmation are also subjected to scrutiny. These skills are assessed on the basis of an oral presentation, written essays in examinations, and in class discussions.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students are required to give an oral presentation to the class. In class discussions, claims that are not backed up with evidence or argument are always questioned. The written midterm and final examinations require argumentative essays in answer to questions as well as critical commentary on selected quotations.</p>
<p><strong>SW-1:</strong> The nature of science provides the matter of the course, so the fundamental concepts and methods of the natural sciences are examined. Different accounts of the character of scientific confirmation disagree over which concepts and methods are fundamental, and these disagreements are also explored. Oral and written assignments test students’ understanding of these disagreements and their significance. Stepping back, students also learn to ask second-order questions about these disagreements. If these questions about science are not scientific questions, what sorts of questions are they?</p>
<p><strong>SW-2:</strong> Students who understand scientific methods, (e.g., correlation, sampling, hypothesis development, statistical significance) can appreciate the power of the natural sciences to frame, investigate, and analyze problems; and to develop and assess potential solutions to them. They can also appreciate the limits on this power. Oral presentations focus on a particular scientific advance: the state of knowledge before the advance; the history of the advance and the role of experiment, evidence, or observation in it; whether the advance was illusory or real, etc.</p>
<p><strong>SW-3:</strong> The significance of empirical evidence in theory confirmation in the natural sciences is one of the main topics of the course. How are observations related to the theories designed to account for them? How do we decide between rival theories that account equally well for the same evidence? The understanding acquired by students concerning the role of empirical evidence is assessed in every assignment: an oral presentation, written answers in examinations, and in class discussion.</p>

<h3 id="SWPHYS3">PHYS 3 Physics of Musical Sound [SW SCI]</h3><h4>Approved 2012-12-05</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> This course is designed to be comprehensible and interesting to students without a physics, math and/or music background. Therefore, the largest part of the knowledge is acquired through lecture and extensive demonstrations (including sound recordings illustrating various phenomena, instruments purchased for Physics 7- trumpet, clarinet, harmonica, Jew’s harp, electronic keyboard, etc.). The first five lectures are devoted to an introduction to sound and wave phenomena, and the workings of our hearing system: reflection, diffraction, interference, etc. The first four labs are designed to allow the students to see how the theories work in practice. For example:- One lab lets students measure Ehrlenmeyer flasks and predict the frequency they produce when you blow across the top; then they measure the frequency and compare the results.- One lab allows students to adjust the length of an cylinder of air until they achieve resonance, and use this to measure the speed of sound in air; this value is then compared to a value found by another method, and the two values are compared.In each lab, the students are asked questions beyond what was taught in lecture, and answer them by direct experiment.The next lecture is devoted to our hearing system: ear-nerves-brain. This is critical to understanding how we perceive sound, consonance and dissonance, and how we listen.The rest of the course is dedicated to the “hows” and “whys” of music- how it is measured, the workings and intricacies of instruments, how instruments are tuned, etc. Experiments are designed to allow students to apply this knowledge. For example: - Baroque recorders will be given to each student, and they will measure the semitone ratios to see how it is tuned.- Students will use a sonometer (a resonance box with strings stretched across) to learn the principles of stringed instruments: how the frequency produced by the strings are influenced by the length, tension and weight per length of the string.Again: knowledge from lectures is applied, but new material is learend by direct experiment.Finally: homework is assigned. It is not graded, but I will go over it at the start of each lecture. Students are asked two types of questions: one is straight information (did the students understand the lecture?); the other are applications (can they apply what was learned?). Even if they cannot answer the questions themselves, they will learn about applications as the homework is reviewed.

The course will meet twice a week, and approximately one-third of these meetings will be labs (meeting in a different lab room).  If the course has over 30 students (as it usually has in the past), then the class will be split into two parts, and each part will meet separately (due to the restriction on spaces in the lab room).</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> There are two areas of study in this course- physics of waves, and music. Students of both subjects will learn much to help them, and since both apply to the real world, both have application to the “larger society”— Learning how to listen synthetically and analytically, and how these two methods can change what you hear.- Learning about the division of the octave, with some discussion of non-European systems.- Learning about consonance and dissonance, and why some sounds are pleasant and others not.- Learning about the different instruments: their sound, how they constructed, how they work, why they sound like they do, the problems faced when playing them, etc. Where there is time, some historical information is also included.- Learning about how instruments are tuned; especially the piano and stringed instruments.- Included is the mathematics of temperament (Phythagorean, equal, meantone, etc.), as well as an explanation of logarithmic scales (because the frequency of the notes in the scale and the loudness scale are logarithmic.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> Some examples:
We discuss temperament from the point of view of the Medieval world (Gregorian chants, pieces using only fifths and fourths), the Renaissance and Classical periods (when thirds were used and old systems of temperament failed), and the so-called Romantic period (when modulation became common, and equal temperament became standard).
We discuss pitch standard, which changed as brass instruments came into the orchestra, and the pitch of the orchestra rose to its current value.  We also discuss the effect this had on the construction of instruments, particularly the violin, and how it caused problems with other instruments (such as the flute).
We discuss how and why instruments became part of the orchestra, and then were replaced by other instruments (for example: why the flute replaced the recorder).</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> We do this especially in labs: students gather data, and use the data to calculate various quantities.  However: the real challenge is in the questions they must answer: often there are multiple choice questions followed by “Explain your answer”.  For such quesions, students are asked to analyze the results of an experiment, and explain why the data came out as it did.  Also: students will be asked to predict values for the experiment using other equipment (so the measured values would be different).  For the recorder experiment, for example, students are asked to use the intervals they have measured to predict the frequency of a note they did not measure.  In the resonance experiment, students are asked to predict the frequency produced by an air column of a size they did not see.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> There are two places where students are asked for reasoned responses: in the homework and in labs.  The homework questions are of two types- questions that basically ask if the student understood the material, and questions that ask if the student can use the information they learned to predict the result of other situations.  For example: if you understand Bernoulli’s principle (dealing with pressure in moving fluids), you can explain how an aspirator works, or why the tarpaulin on a truck flaps.  If you understand resonance in plates, you can explain how the plates of a good stringed instrument should be tuned.  I will also put some “reasoning” quesions on exams.

In lab, students are asked for answers to questions, and then asked to explain.  This is a request for a well-reasoned argument.</p>
<p><strong>SW-1:</strong> At the center of every lab is the scientific method: material supplied in lecture form the hypothesis, and experiments are done to determine if the hypothesis is true.  In addition: questions are asked, in the labs and homeworks, that require the student to deduce further information based on the data they have gathered.  For example: students determine the temperament used in their recorder, and on the basis of this should be able to deduce the notes in the scale whose frequencies have not been measured.</p>
<p><strong>SW-2:</strong> There are many problems in musical instrument design that are solved by advanced technology and/or mathemtics.
- Where should the frets be placed on a guitar to produce a proper scale?
- How can a violin be constructed to produce a tone like that of a Stradivarius?
- Why are some woods perfect for soundboards, and others are not?  Can we construct artificial
  materials that have the correct properties?
- How can we set the notes of a scale so every key is playable?
Questions like these are were originally solved by trial-and-error, but modern techniques- mathematics, laser interference, computers, etc.- allows a more accurate and scientific solution.</p>
<p><strong>SW-3:</strong> Each theory that applies to the physics of music- Mersenne’s laws for the frequency of strings, Helmholtz’s equations for resonating air cavities (which apply to wind instruments), interference and resonance equations, etc. were developed empirically.  Students will learn about these theories and how they were developed in lecture.  Then, they will have an opportunity to demonstrate these principles in lab, and to use their results to predict other results</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives NS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong>   Previously approved for the Perspectives NS Area of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> As indicated in the syllabus, students gather, interpret and assess information from a variety of sources and points of view primarily through a REQUIREMENT for all students: a fiv-page paper that counts 1/3 of the student grade. All students are given an opportunity to choose from among eight different primary research areas in the course, Pleasure and Pain. When they select the area, they will prepare a one-page synopsis of why they chose the area through expository writing; this synopsis will be critically reviewed by the instructor or one of the Teaching Assistants. Each student is then assigned three unique primary-source and peer-reviewed research papers in that area. Each studfent is then REQUIRED to write a five-page paper that includes their original edited one-page expository essay, three pages of transactional synopses of each of the three articles, followed by a one-page expository summary of the how the individual dindings contribute to the overall area. The five-page paper is then graded as one-third of the grade.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> The entire course is based on a series of Powerpoint presentations given by the two instructors (Provost Stellar and Dean Bodnar) and/or guest lecturers (President presenting philosophical underpinnings of Pleasure and Pain, and faculty from Literature, Media Studies, Economics, Anthropology and Psychology). Students carry on a spitrited “social media” interaction with the Provost during and after classes in which they indicate critical and analytic arguments as well as by peer-led Discussion groups. This allows the large-class (250 student) format to accommodate these issues. Of course, the paper described above gives the students a gradable place to show their critical and analytic skills.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> The Pleasure and Pain course has NO textbook; given the INTERDISCIPLINARY nature of the course, there is none. As described in the written syllabus, there are specialized Powerpoint presentations (some are 15-20 slides, and some are as high as 60 slides) that are ALL made available to the students on Blackboard along with the syllabus and course schedule BEFORE  the class starts. In addition, every class is videotaped, and the tape is also made available on Blackboard. The above first section provides the student’s opportunity to produce well-written arguments using evidence to support conclusions in writing the required paper. Indeed, the five-page paper described above and in the syllabus is graded on the basis of how well students make a well-reasoned written argument about the summaries of the three assigned peer-reviewed articles as well as the expositiory summary.</p>
<p><strong>SW-1:</strong> As indicated in the course justification, Psychology 103 is an introduction to the psychological, philosophical, biological, neurochemical, sociological and evolutionary facts, principles, and theories underlying the concepts of pleasure and pain. Topics discussed include basic neuroscience and psychology of pleasure and pain systems, application to homeostasis, pain inhibition, and addiction.  Within psychology application is made to concepts of neuroeconomics, wanting vs liking, empathy, and other aspects of human interaction.  Translational implications are explored including psychopathological and neurological disorders and their treatment.  Wider examination of principles learned from these basic mechanisms will be considered from philosophical, anthropological (evolutionary), sociological and economic views, and  include our understanding of these principles from literary, media and other perspectives. Throughout the course, comparisons are made between classic and current theories and empirical data.</p>

<h3 id="SWPSYCH252">PSYCH 252 Application of Behavior Analysis in Animal Training [LP SCI]</h3><h4>Approved 2012-12-05</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> The broad topic of the course is application of the science of behavior in producing and analyzing behavior change. Students will learn to observe and analyze behavior objectively and ask behavioral questions they can test. The goal is for the student to study behavior as a natural science in which answers can be quantified, verified and replicated. Questions will not be theoretical. Training simple behaviors to an animal provides the opportunity for the student to watch behavior unfold as it happens and then analyze the data collected.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> The science of behavior expands our understanding of human behavior using experimentation to identify laws specifying the relation between past events and future action. Theories of behavior have emerged from and exist within intellectual context such as philosophy, biology and psychiatry. These fields also focus on the nature of behavior but rely on diverse approaches. The science of behavior can speak to these alternative disciplines and can grow as a field by attempting to analyze phenomena not typically address by other behavior theories.

An understanding of basic learning principles can have far reaching effects. Students who learn behavior analysis and its practical application become aware of how the environment affects behavior. The planned course revolves around understanding how to change the behavior of another living being by changing your own behavior. Students must find ways to teach the animal by applying basic learning principles, without the use of force, and to evaluate their success. Students learn to view behavior objectively, including their own, and how to apply learning principals to change behavior cooperatively.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> The textbook provides the foundation for the breadth of information covered on the topic of behavior analysis. Additional readings from scientific papers and excerpts from experts in the field supplement textbook reading and broaden the points of view. Lectures provide students with many examples of behavior from various species and students are asked to analyze these behaviors in order to develop a global picture of the basic principles of learning. Multiple exemplars instruct students how to gather information through detailed observation and analysis.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> During lab, the instructor will guide students through training. Students will learn how to observe behavior objectively and how to choose and measure relevant dimensions of behavior in order to analyze how effectively they are training their animal. Students have an opportunity to experience how difficult it is to control all variables in an applied setting and to learn they must be carefully not to make unjustified inferences. Class discussion provides time for students to critically discuss data from their observations and to discuss what further research design might be used to support a cause and effect relationships between behavior and the environment.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> Students will keep a training log, which will serve as a sort of “Method” section of their training design. Each training plan is a written report that details the goal of each training session, a breakdown of the successive approximations toward the goal, the duration of each training session, number of trials per session, number of correct and incorrect trials, etc. The student will also write a critique of how well they believe they implemented their training plan and justify the changes to the next plan based on the data collected. This process of reasoning is designed to prevent training sessions from being conducted “haphazardly.” Students must be able to articulate in their training plan and in-class discussions what they are doing and why.</p>
<p><strong>SW-1:</strong> The main goal of this course is for students to recognize the basic behavioral mechanisms at work across all species. Knowing these principles intellectually is one way of understanding them, however this course is designed to give the students an opportunity to apply these principles and observe how they work. Training an animal in an open filed allows the student to engage with an animal that has many choices about how it will behave. This situation is a more realistic model of the how behavior works and gives students a unique opportunity to learn scientific principles in a more applied setting. In this type of context, the student learns quickly that many variables are in play when trying to build or change behavior and although the principles of learning may be simple; being a good teacher/behavior changer is not easy!</p>
<p><strong>SW-2:</strong> Students will learn about the tools of science in the assigned readings, but the principles of behavior science will be most clearly illuminated in each training session when the student is faced with the need to change the behavior of the animal in front of them. The student can then experience basic behavior principles. For example, if a behavior is not maintained or increasing in frequency, then by definition it is not being reinforced. The student must respond to this objective assessment of behavior by changing their training plan. The problem is no longer theoretical but one that needs to be solved right then by formal analysis. It is up to the student to figure out how to solve the problem by systematically altering the relationship between the behavior and the environment until a behavior change is measured. A new analysis is then required to determine the success or failure of the intervention. The constantly changing variables provided by the animal can be challenging and allow students to discover multiple ways to solve problems.</p>
<p><strong>SW-3:</strong> Applied behavior analysis is a separate field of study from other psychology or social science disciplines, and like other natural sciences, it looks at behavior as a naturally occurring phenomenon. Behavior is a field of study where there is much speculation. By contrast, behavior analysis is systematic in its approach to understanding behavior. Its assumptions are deterministic. It relies on empirical data and uses experimentation as its methodology. In this course, students will be taught to look at behavior through the lens of a behavior analyst, and to make inferences only when they can be supported by data. From here, students will learn to turn their ideas into research questions that lend themselves to further scientific study that might support their hypotheses.</p>
<p><strong>SW-4:</strong> During the course there will be much discussion of the ethical issues surrounding methods of teaching. The last hundred years of discoveries about how we learn and the resulting behavioral technology, have changed how we treat those who have difficulty learning. Applied behavior analysis is a field primarily dedicated to work with the developmentally disabled so a discussion of the ethics of teaching this population will be discussed. Also important will be discussion of approaches to teaching for those who are not developmentally disabled and approaches to teaching the non-human population. This discussion will include the negative views of behavior analysis as manipulative and dangerous and how this view fits into our present understanding of behavioral technology.</p>
<p><strong>SW-5:</strong> It is certainly hoped that by understanding the universality of behavior principles, students may rethink why people act as they do. From world leaders, to the annoying neighbor next door, the ability to view the world with objectivity can be difficult. Why does the president make compromises? Why is it hard to be objective about your sibling or loved one? Human beings are the only animal that can manipulate their own environment to the degree we can. These are questions that we will consider in discussions about behavioral mechanisms at work. Using examples from the student’s immediate world and society as a whole will be encouraged during lecture and discussion.</p>
<h3 id="SWSOC235">SOC 235 <span class="not-found">Not Found</span></h3><h4>Approved 2017-10-25</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> This course is in the discipline of Data Analytics. As such, the whole course is about data. The course specifically examines how data are collected and created and how this creation of information sometimes leads to knowledge acquisition and other times leads to unintended consequences. In the second part of the course, students try their hands at thinking like data analysts, interpreting and asking questions of data and seeing if they agree with the conclusions in the cases.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> The course examines the impact, use, and importance of data for several societal use cases including business, healthcare, politics and national security, media, and technology.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-1:</strong> This course looks at data and the big data revolution from several viewpoints: proponents of data who feel that proper use can contribute to better decisions and possibly a better society; critics who are concerned about the loss of privacy; engineers who imagine that computers will be successfully using and analyzing large amounts of data on their own; and agnostics who believe that the use of data depends on the quality of questions, the data itself, and our analysis. Roughly the first half of the course identifies and explores these different viewpoints through readings, discussions, and exercises. In the second part of the course, students will apply these perspectives to evaluate the role of data in the use cases.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-2:</strong> Students will be asked to analyze and compare each of the viewpoints and arguments listed above. In addition, the last several weeks of the course focus on data use cases related to important social issues. They will look carefully at how data have been created, collected, and used in those cases and, calling upon the various views about data as well as the data interpretation skills taught in the course, they will make their own judgments.</p>
<p><strong>FCC-3:</strong> For the use cases described above, students will be asked to write two kinds of arguments in support of their conclusions. First, they will need to reason through the social and political impacts of the case and provide a strong argument about help or harm. Second, they will need to write arguments based on data itself, using information presented in tables, charts, and graphs to support their arguments. Writing well-reasoned arguments and writing arguments supported with data points are two different but complementary skills, and students in this course will practice both.</p>
<p><strong>SW-1:</strong> Students will describe the digital and big data revolutions using concepts from history and sociology of science, statistics, management information systems, and technology-related studies on artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>
<p><strong>SW-2:</strong> Students will demonstrate how data analytics and statistical research can be used rigorously to analyze problems, develop solutions, and shape decisions and policy. They will engage with both positive and negative examples, including examples of successes using data and analysis as well as those where the data or the (possibly faulty)analysis have failed to produce desirable results.</p>
<p><strong>SW-3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>SW-4:</strong> Students will articulate and evaluate the impact of big data and data analytics on the contemporary world, particularly in relation to student’s everyday life and regarding issues of ethics and privacy. In particular, we will deal with collection of data and use of data associated students’ everyday activities, including, for example, driving, online shopping, talking on the phone, and contacting friends through Snapchat or other social media.</p>
<p><strong>SW-5:</strong> Students will understand and assess the role of data and data analytics in case studies of matters of policy or public concern, including applications to business, education, media, politics, healthcare, and technology.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-1:</strong> This course satisfies electives in the Sociology major. It will also serve as the introductory requirement to our newly proposed Data Analytics minor.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-2:</strong> None.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-3:</strong> We are developing exercises and use cases for this course in collaboration with Wiley Publishing. We will pilot the course in a large “on the ground” section in the fall and hope to also pilot it online in the spring. Given the interest in data throughout CUNY and the dearth of introductory courses like this one, we anticipate that this will be a popular course, drawing students from Queens and other campuses.</p>

<h3 id="LITEAST251">EAST 251 Modern Japanese Fiction in Translation [RLA LIT]</h3><h4>Approved 2016-04-14</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Students will learn to apply methods of literary analysis through close reading of the assigned texts. The instructor facilitates learning through prompts for short written responses due before class on Blackboard, and directs class discussion through analytical questions and occasional lectures on the historical context of the texts read.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> The readings are approached both as literary artifacts and as a window into the Japanese experience of the 20th century, including modernization, colonialism, postwar democratization and globalization. Students will gain an awareness of the impact of literary fiction on the formation of particular world-views and identities, integrating a wide range of artistic, historical and social concerns, relevant for an organic view of our modern world.</p>
<p><strong>LIT-1:</strong> Through close reading of the texts in their historical context, the students will understand the possibilities of literature to express the complexity of human experience. Attention will be paid to the use of literary devices such as narrative point of view to represent contrasting views of reality.</p>
<p><strong>LIT-2:</strong> The course has significant reading assignments for every session. A variety of assessment tools (such as pre-class posting and in-class quizzes) will be deployed to ensure that all students have completed and understood the reading for the day.</p>
<p><strong>LIT-3:</strong> The readings assigned cover a wide swath of genres, including fiction and drama, from the naturalist novel to fantasy or mystery literature. In-class analysis of the texts will pay close attention to their use (and subversion) of generic conventions in order to create meaning.</p>
<p><strong>LIT-4:</strong> In-class discussion will be facilitated in order to give students a chance to practice and develop their close reading skills, guiding them in appreciating the texts both as historical documents and as literary art. Written assessments (in-class tests and final exam or paper) will be designed to help students synthesize the knowledge they have acquired throughout the semester.</p>

<h3 id="LITENGL157">ENGL 157 Readings in Global Literatures in English [WG LIT]</h3><h4>Approved 2015-05-07</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Knowledge is acquired through in-class discussions, writing assignments, readings, and the occasional lecture. The course data is the assigned reading, which is composed of both primary and secondary sources: novels, poems, stories, essays, and scholarly articles. Students are asked to answer questions in class through instructor-led discussions, in informal writing assignments (in class and online), and in formal essays assignments where they are asked to demonstrate that they understand and can synthesize the material covered.

For example, questions will be typically asked in class discussion in order to encourage students to engage with literary texts in a critical and close manner. Such discussions would then be supplemented by lectures to help students learn how literature is read in the context of historical and aesthetic questions about politics and art. Students would then demonstrate the knowledge they acquired through writing essays and/ or writing exams (depending on the instructor).</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Literary Studies, and particular the study of Global Literature, gives students a lens through which to understand some of the major concerns of a liberal arts curriculum: students are taught to read closely and critically, to think about how texts reflect historical and current events, to understand the human condition, and to appreciate the aesthetics of writing. Acquiring these skills will give students a better understanding of world culture, art, and politics, and ideally, make them critical thinkers and leaders.</p>
<p><strong>LIT-1:</strong> This course positions global literature in English in a literary historical context and offers close critical reading so that students gain an understanding and appreciation of reading literature from different cultural and historical locations. The work in this class is in part aimed at teaching students to understand how literature is in conversation with history, politics, and religion, and that by reading literature we can begin the work of understanding how certain identities are formed.</p>
<p><strong>LIT-2:</strong> Students will read widely in this class to learn how to close read, synthesize texts, and create coherent arguments about the assigned material.</p>
<p><strong>LIT-3:</strong> As a global literature in English course, a wide range of genres will be assigned in this class that will likely vary both stylistically and aesthetically. A global literature course is by nature comparative, and one of the goals of this course will be to teach students how literature from different world cultures in influenced by various traditions and histories.</p>
<p><strong>LIT-4:</strong> In-class discussion (required of the course), several papers, exams, as well as other assignments throughout the semester ask students to develop critical appreciation and understanding of literature. Other sections of this course might also require an oral presentation and/ or informal online writing in order to help students process the class discussions and reading assignments, and to build on the skills necessary to write strong papers in English courses and in other disciplines.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-1:</strong> This is a course for non-majors.</p>

linguistic characteristics of the work under consideration.</p>

<h3 id="LANGFREN205">FREN 205 Introduction to Literary Analysis [WG LIT LANG]</h3><h4>Approved 2012-11-08</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Students learn and apply the methods and vocabulary of close reading and literary stylistics, two key approaches in the field of French literature.  Since these approaches rely heavily on familiarity with  norms and variations of grammar and phonetics, students apply this knowledge to their analysis of literary texts.  Students begin the semester answering questions about individual works of literature on the online bulletin board.  As their skill in literary analysis develops, they formulate their own questions and answers related to works on the syllabus.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Knowledge of French or another language other than English is an essential part of the liberal arts curriculum in that it allows students to engage directly with works of literature from Francophone cultures and to understand them in their linguistic context.  In written assignments, students address the influence of ideas and approaches from other disciplines on the study of literature.  Since the literary works on the syllabus are drawn from different historical periods, cultural traditions, and literary movements, students analyze in writing and discussion the impact of historical, artistic, linguistic, and political phenomena on literary genres and techniques.  Written assignments require students to reflect on the role of literature in the French language in Francophone countries, in the U.S., and in the world.</p>

<h3 id="LANGFREN370">FREN 370 Topics in Francophone Literature [WG LIT LANG]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-03-08</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Students will learn to identify and analyze relationships between literary discourse, genres, and historical/cultural context.  They will apply the methods and vocabulary of close reading and literary stylistics, key approaches in the field of French literature.  During the course of the semester, students will examine a number of different ideological and critical approaches to Francophone fiction and use these readings as models for their own written analysis of works on the syllabus.  Students formulate informed questions on the literary texts on the syllabus before each class meeting.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> In reading and written assignments, students address the influence of ideas and approaches from other disciplines (art, music, sociology, history, political science, philosophy, psychology) on the study of literature.  Since the literary works on the syllabus are drawn from different geographic areas, historical moments, cultural traditions, and literary movements, students analyze in writing and discussion the impact of historical, artistic, linguistic, and political phenomena on the evolution of literary genres and techniques. Francophone literature, in particular, exists in a unique relationship with colonialism and post-colonialism in that the choice of expression in the French language represents a choice to maintain, yet transform the language of the former colonial power. Written assignments require students to reflect on the role of literature in the French language in Francophone countries, in the U.S., and in the world.</p>

<h3 id="LANGGRKMD223">GRKMD 223 Modern Greek Conversation [WG LANG]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-03-08</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Through in-class oral practice in the Greek language and discussion of the rules of Greek grammar, vocabulary, and phonetics, students will gain awareness of the cognitive processes involved in adult second-language acquisition and improve their listening comprehension skills and ability to understand spoken native-speaker language. This includes a focus on functional understanding and the nuanced application of familiar constructions. As in previous coursework in Greek, development of reading, speaking and listening using a variety of written, audio and visual media is a priority. Oral exercises will allow students to identify and articulate the advantages and challenges encountered by adult second language learners.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Knowledge of Greek or another foreign language and culture is an essential part of the liberal arts curriculum. Foreign language learning allows students to engage directly with cultural productions from other cultures and to understand them in their linguistic, cultural, and social contexts. Transcultural competencies are vital to a broader knowledge of the modern world and to current globalizing tendencies.</p>

<h3 id="LANGITAL204">ITAL 204 Intermediate Italian II [WG LANG]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-03-08</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> In this course students review and extend their mastery of Italian grammar and vocabulary through a variety of oral and writing assignments. Students are also exposed to culturally relevant materials (selections from Italian literary and non literary texts, as well as movies). Through the study and practice of grammar and vocabulary students gain awareness of the cognitive processes involved in adult second-language acquisition and identify and articulate the advantages and challenges encountered by adult second language learners. Through readings and discussions of cultural materials, students enhance their Italian language proficiency and broaden their understanding of Italian culture and history.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Italian is one of the European languages particularly relevant to the Queens College student body, which includes a considerable number of heritage speakers with proficiency in their respective local Italian dialects, but a less well-developed mastery of modern standard Italian. In addition, knowledge of Italian or another language other than English is an essential part of the liberal arts curriculum in that it allows students to engage directly with cultural productions from another culture and to understand them in their linguistic and social context. Written assignments require students to reflect on the place of the Italian language in both Italy and the United States, as well as on the relevance of Italian cultural productions across time to our twenty-first century realities. Knowledge of one or more foreign languages is a valuable asset for students considering graduate school or seeking employment in the international field. Italian is particularly useful for students who are pursuing careers in education, translation/interpreting, international business and law, journalism, travel, and hospitality, among others.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Language is a complex system of multiple sub-systems such as phonetics, vocabulary, and grammar, which have their own governing rules. As a native speaker of at least one language, we all have certain knowledge, whether implicit or explicit, on the phonetics, vocabulary, and grammar systems of our language, and thus this knowledge is readily applicable to foreign languages we learn. Using their knowledge on language as a system of systems, students are encouraged to attempt to generalize sound patterns, morphological rules, and grammatical patterns based on the language input they are given from the audio/video/textual materials and instructors. They are also encouraged to identify exceptions and irregular forms to their generalizations and learn about how to effectively deal with them. In doing so, students are asked to compare the structural properties of Korean with those of their own language to better understand the distinctive characteristics of Korean sound, word, and sentence structures.
Language is also a tool for communication which reflects the social customs and cultural uniqueness. Students are taught to understand that language should be not just grammatically correct and meaningful but also socio-culturally adequate and natural. Therefore, students should always ask: What is the best translation? Is it the most accurate? The most complete? Or the one that is most natural and adequate? Students will find answers to these questions regarding communicative and cultural aspects of the Korean language by gathering information from the audio/video/textual course materials, learning from lectures/explanations by instructors, and participating in the conversational and presentational activities. 
All Korean language courses also aims to equip students with a certain level of fluency. With practice, language becomes easier to use. In fact, ease of use in an increasing number of contexts is one way to characterize fluency. Therefore, students will constantly ask themselves about the effective ways of language learning: How do we improve our fluency? Learn more words? Become more culturally aware? Does practice make perfect? Students are required to do a variety of assignments and will learn by experience what are the best or most effective practices for them.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> In general, language is of central importance to all human interaction. Even the adaptation of the notion of “text” to films, music, etc extends the metaphor of language to non-verbal domains. Therefore, it should be a given that a course of instruction that is dedicated to raising awareness of such a central human activity has a place in a liberal arts curriculum.
In particular, Korean, as a foreign language, opens up the possibility for students to learn more about the Korean-speaking society, whether they are more into the language per se or other disciplines such as politics, history, pop-culture, literature, philosophy, business, or even science and engineering. Knowledge of Korean allows students to engage directly with cultural productions from the area(s) where the language is spoken and to understand them in their linguistic and social context. Also, knowledge of one or more foreign languages is a valuable asset for students considering graduate school or seeking employment in the international field. Therefore, it can be concluded that Korean is an essential part of the liberal arts curriculum.</p>

<h3 id="LANGLCD101">LCD 101 <span class="inactive">Currently Inactive</span></h3><h4>Approved 2013-05-09</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> Introduction to Language is a survey course that explores linguistics by providing introductions to each of its subfields. Subfields are divided into two types. One consists of either explorations of different types of linguistic structures as in phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, or discourse patterns. The other involves how linguistic structure intersects with other aspects of human life. How children or adults acquire first or additional languages (first and second language acquisition), how language relates to society (sociolinguistics), how language compares to non-human or other human communication systems (biolinguistics), and how it is deployed in every day interactions (pragmatics). In introducing each of these areas, students are given examples of problems the subfield examines, important findings, and studies that led to those findings.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Linguistics is said to be the most humanistic of the sciences and the most scientific of the humanities. This aphorism is the result of the position of its object of study,  language, at the fulcrum of primary divisions of the liberal arts curriculum. It is a unique human biological trait; it is the material of many of the most important arts; and it has been the subject of speculation and interpretative, empirical, and analytic investigation since the ancient Indian and Greek philosophers. In the borough of Queens home of speakers of over 100 languages, understanding what language is and is not, how it functions, how different and how similar different languages are, and how it relates to social identities are crucial areas of understanding of everyday social interactions.</p>

<h3 id="LANGLCD102">LCD 102 Analyzing Language [SW LANG SCI]</h3><h4>Approved 2013-03-08</h4>
<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> The subject of the course is linguistic structure or formal linguistics, which comprises analysis at various levels:  phonology (sound structure), morphology (word structure), syntax (phrase and sentence structure), semantics (structural aspects of meaning), and pragmatics (contextual aspects of meaning). Formal linguistic hypotheses in all these areas hypotheses propose specific abstract analyses of structures attested in individual languages and dialects. They are confirmed or refuted empirically, based on their provision of consistent explanatory accounts for why the structures or patterns of structures are found, whereas other structures or co-occurrence of structures are not found. Data to confirm or refute hypotheses are derived in two ways: 1) through attestation of structures in corpora of actual speech and writing and 2) through native speakers’ intuitive judgments of which structures are grammatical or possible versus ungrammatical or impossible in their language.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Formal linguistics, under the rubric of grammar, is one of the oldest areas of scholarship although at earlier times efforts were limited to classification, typology and taxonomy of language patterns. This subject matter also formed a core area of education in the Western tradition for many centuries. In the 19th Century, grammar joined rhetoric and literary criticism to form philology and later, in the US on the school level, language arts. More recently, however, the position of grammar in language arts declined significantly. At the same time, the scientific study of language, linguistics, has largely replaced the philological tradition in language research.

LCD 102 is an effort to reengage with the skill set and the awareness of the nature of the primary means of human communication that has been lost with the decline of grammar instruction. In its contemporary scientific incarnation, grammar study engages the natural human curiosity about how human language, by far the most complex of known natural communication systems, works. The type of analysis uses inductive reasoning based on empirical facts to arrive at abstract generalizations that account for superficially heterogeneous phenomena. These generalizations reveal how different languages are characterized by systematic similarities and differences.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> This world languages course is designed to develop and challenge students’ ability in speaking, reading, writing, listening, and culture development in Spanish. Students will gain awareness of the cognitive processes involved in acquiring new knowledge of Spanish as their heritage tongue. For most people, a native speaker is one who can function in all settings in which other native speakers normally function. Moreover, to be considered fully native, a speaker must be indistinguishable for other native speakers (Valdés 1998, 153). Heritage speakers may be classified as individuals who speak their first language, which is not English, in the home, or are foreign-born (Campbell and Peyton 1998). Heritage language learners may also be defined as individuals who have learned a language other than English somewhere other than in school (Scalera 1997; Teaching Heritage Language Learners: Voices from the Classroom, Jamie B. Draper and June H. Hicks, “Where We’ve Been; What We’ve Learned,”, 19–20).</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Traditionally, heritage Spanish speakers have been placed in Spanish classes with English speakers learning Spanish as a second language. This can be problematic. Other students may resent the heritage speakers’ native-like familiarity with oral language and the appearance that the Spanish speakers are studying “a language they already know” (Peyton, Lewelling, &amp; Winke, 2001, 1). At the same time, while the Spanish speakers may be able to discuss day-to-day topics related to home and community, they may have difficulty communicating about more complex topics, such as politics, literature, or careers, and with the mechanics of Spanish writing, such as spelling, syntax, and use of accents. This situation is challenging for heritage Spanish speakers and potentially frustrating for other students. “Neither the Spanish language needs nor the abilities of either group can be duly or successfully addressed” (Peale, 1991, 448). Increasingly, researchers and educators realize that these students need courses tailored to their specific needs (Bills, 1997).
This course offers Spanish-speaking students the opportunity to study Spanish formally in an academic setting in the same way native English-speaking students study English language arts. The course allows students to reactivate the Spanish they have learned previously and develop it further, to learn more about their language and cultural heritage, to acquire Spanish literacy skills, to develop or augment Spanish academic language skills, and to enhance career opportunities. 
Spanish is increasingly important in the interdependent global community of the twenty-first century. Knowledge of Spanish or another language other than English is an essential part of the liberal arts curriculum in that it allows students to engage directly with cultural productions from Hispanic cultures and to understand them in their linguistic and social context. Written assignments require students to reflect on the place of the Spanish language in the countries where this language is spoken, in the U.S., and in the world. Also, knowledge of one or more foreign languages is a valuable asset for students considering graduate school or seeking employment in the international field.

Moreover, to be considered fully native, a speaker must be indistinguishable for other native speakers (Valdés 1998, 153). Heritage speakers may be classified as individuals who speak their first language, which is not English, in the home, or are foreign-born (Campbell and Peyton 1998). Heritage language learners may also be defined as individuals who have learned a language other than English somewhere other than in school (Scalera 1997; Teaching Heritage Language Learners: Voices from the Classroom, Jamie B. Draper and June H. Hicks, “Where We’ve Been; What We’ve Learned,”, 19–20).</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Traditionally, heritage Spanish speakers have been placed in Spanish classes with English speakers learning Spanish as a second language. This can be problematic. Other students may resent the heritage speakers’ native-like familiarity with oral language and the appearance that the Spanish speakers are studying “a language they already know” (Peyton, Lewelling, &amp; Winke, 2001, 1). At the same time, while the Spanish speakers may be able to discuss day-to-day topics related to home and community, they may have difficulty communicating about more complex topics, such as politics, literature, or careers, and with the mechanics of Spanish writing, such as spelling, syntax, and use of accents. This situation is challenging for heritage Spanish speakers and potentially frustrating for other students. “Neither the Spanish language needs nor the abilities of either group can be duly or successfully addressed” (Peale, 1991, 448). Increasingly, researchers and educators realize that these students need courses tailored to their specific needs (Bills, 1997).
This course offers Spanish-speaking students the opportunity to study Spanish formally in an academic setting in the same way native English-speaking students study English language arts. The course allows students to reactivate the Spanish they have learned previously and develop it further, to learn more about their language and cultural heritage, to acquire Spanish literacy skills, to develop or augment Spanish academic language skills, and to enhance career opportunities. Spanish is increasingly important in the interdependent global community of the twenty-first century. Knowledge of Spanish or another language other than English is an essential part of the liberal arts curriculum in that it allows students to engage directly with cultural productions from Hispanic cultures and to understand them in their linguistic and social context. Written assignments require students to reflect on the place of the Spanish language in the countries where this language is spoken, in the U.S., and in the world. Also, knowledge of one or more foreign languages is a valuable asset for students considering graduate school or seeking employment in the international field. Spanish is particularly useful for students who are pursuing careers in education, medicine, social work, and law.</p>

<p><strong>QC-1:</strong> The course synthesizes two complementary forms of inquiry on the topic of language in
urban society: the quantitative analytic approaches that predominate in sociolinguistics
and the qualitative analytic and ethnographic ones that predominate in linguistic
anthropology. In both cases, empirical data are gathered from local communities using
recordings of interviews, interactions of individuals, elicitation of specific types of language
through experimental procedures, and/or participant observation.

This course has been approved previously as a synthesis course.</p>
<p><strong>QC-2:</strong> Sociolinguistics and Linguistic Anthropology are empirical and analytic forms of inquiry
that examine language in use. They contain elements of social science research approaches
and more humanistic ones.

Student research provides excellent opportunities to fulfill the objectives of synthesis course.  Language issues present in students’ local communities are particularly suitable as research topics from the point of view of learning.  First of all language is ubiquitous and easily available for data collection. Also language issues are compelling.  People have strong feelings and opinions about language issues.  The research challenge is that these attitudes are sometimes covert and often motivated by unexamined by stereotypes. Exploring these issues will allow students to look beyond the stereotypes.  They will learn to use analytical and research tools, which will allow them to reveal what motivates these beliefs and covert attitudes.  They will be able to see the connections between everyday life and academic research and theory.</p>
<p><strong>SYN-1:</strong> In this course students careful read between seven and eight published primary/empirical research studies that take sociolinguistic or linguistic anthropological approaches or combine both traditions. They provide precis of these articles in the form of answers to questions that focus on methods, research challenges, and syntheses. In addition, classes provide background
in major concepts and theories in Sociolinguistics and Linguistic Anthropology that are
employed in these studies. The single course exam assesses the knowledge of these
concepts and their application in the studies. Also, using these concepts, students pick a
topic on language in New York of their own interest. Using one of the studies they read (or
if necessary one assigned specifically as a model) as a template, they will design their own original research project. Under close guidance from the instructors, the students will collect and analyze data, interpret the findings, and write up and present their results. 
Students will be responsible for investigating a topic of their choosing and answering questions that they have posed. As a result, they will gain hands-on research and writing skills that can prove useful in many professions.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-1:</strong> It is a required course for General Linguistics majors and an elective for Anthropology majors</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-2:</strong> this course is cross-listed with Anthro 288. In fact, course sections meet together using a co-taught model with one instructor from LCD and another from Anthropology.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE-3:</strong> An identical proposal will be uploaded for ANTHRO 288</p>
